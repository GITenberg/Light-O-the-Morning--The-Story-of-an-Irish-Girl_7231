    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. &mdash; NORA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Why, then, Miss Nora&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Hannah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't see the masther going this way, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, Hannah? Father is never at home at this hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought maybe&mdash;" said Hannah. She spoke in a dubious voice,
      backing a little away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannah was a small, squat woman, of a truly Irish type. Her nose was
      celestial, her mouth wide, her eyes dark, and sparkling with fun. She was
      dressed in a short, coarse serge petticoat, with what is called a bedgown
      over it; the bedgown was made of striped calico, yellow and red, and was
      tied in at the waist with a broad band of the same. Hannah's hair was
      strongly inclined to gray, and her humorous face was covered with a
      perfect network of wrinkles. She showed a gleam of snowy teeth now, as she
      looked full at the young girl whom she was addressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then, Miss Nora," she said, "it's I that am sorry for yez."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Nora O'Shanaghgan could utter a word Hannah had turned on her heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back, Hannah," said Nora in an imperious voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Presently, darlint; it's the childer I hear calling me. Coming, Mike
      asthore, coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squat little figure flew down a side walk which led to a paddock:
      beyond the paddock was a turnstile, and at the farther end of an adjacent
      field a cabin made of mud, with one tiny window and a thatched roof.
      Hannah was making for the cabin with rapid, waddling strides. Nora stood
      in the middle of the broad sweep which led up to the front door of the old
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Castle O'Shanaghgan was a typical Irish home of the ancient régime. The
      house, a great square pile, was roomy and spacious; it had innumerable
      staircases, and long passages through which the wind shrieked on stormy
      nights, and a great castellated tower at its north end. This tower was in
      ruins, and had been given up a long time ago to the exclusive tenancy of
      the bats, the owls, and rats so large and fierce that the very dogs were
      afraid of them. In the tower at night the neighbors affirmed that they
      heard shrieks and ghostly noises; and Nora, whose bedroom was nearest to
      it, rejoiced much in the distinction of having twice heard the
      O'Shanaghgan Banshee keening outside her window. Nora was a slender, tall,
      and very graceful girl of about seventeen, and her face was as typical of
      the true, somewhat wild, Irish beauty as Hannah Croneen's was the reverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the southwest of Ireland there are traces of Spanish as well as Celtic
      blood in many of its women; and Nora's quantities of thick, soft,
      intensely black hair must have come to her from a Spanish ancestor. So
      also did the delicately marked black brows and the black lashes to her
      dark and very lovely blue eyes; but the clear complexion, the cheeks with
      the tenderest bloom on them, the softly dimpled lips red as coral, and the
      little teeth white as pearls were true Irish characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora waited for a moment after Hannah had left her, then, shading her eyes
      from the westerly sun by one hand, she turned slowly and went into the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is mother, Pegeen?" she said to a rough-looking, somewhat
      slatternly servant who was crossing the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the north parlor, Miss Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along, then, Creena; come along, Cushla," said the girl, addressing
      two handsome black Pomeranians who rushed to meet her. The dogs leaped up
      at her with expressions of rapture, and girl and dogs careered with a wild
      dance across the great, broad hall in the direction of the north parlor.
      Nora opened the door with a somewhat noisy bang, the dogs precipitated
      themselves into the room, and she followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then, mother dear! and have I disturbed you?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pale-faced lady, who was lying full-length on a very old and hard sofa,
      rose with a querulous expression on her face when Nora entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish someone would teach you thoughtfulness," she said; "you are the
      most tiresome girl in the world. I have been two hours trying to get a
      wink of sleep, and just when I succeed you come in and wake me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's sorry I am to my heart's core," said Nora. She went up to her
      mother, dropped on one knee, and looked with her rosy face into the worn
      and faded one of the elder woman. "Here I am, mammy," she said again,
      "your own little Nora; let me sit with you a bit&mdash;may I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan smiled faintly. She looked all over the girl's slim
      figure, and finally her eyes rested on the laughing, lovely face. Then a
      cloud crossed her forehead, and her eyes became dim with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you heard the last thing, Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are so many last things, mother," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the very last. Your father has to pay back the money which Squire
      Murphy of Cronane lent him. It is the queerest thing; but the mortgagee
      means to foreclose, as he calls it, within three months if that money is
      not paid in full. I know well what it means."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora smiled. She took her mother's hand in hers, and began to stroke it
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose," she said, "it means this. It means that we must part with a
      little more of the beloved land, every sod of which I love. We certainly
      do seem to be getting poorer and poorer; but never mind&mdash;nothing will
      ever alter the fact that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That what, child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That we O'Shanaghgans are the proudest and oldest family in the county,
      and that there is scarcely an Englishman across the water who would not
      give all he possesses to change places with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You talk like a silly child," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan; "and please
      remember that I am English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mummy, I am so sorry!" said the girl. She laid her soft head down on
      the sofa, pressing it against her mother's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot think of you as English," she said. "You have lived here all,
      all my life. You belong to father, and you belong to Terence and me&mdash;what
      have you to do with the cold English?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember a time," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, "when I thought Ireland the
      most desolate and God-forsaken place on the earth. It is true I have
      become accustomed to it now. But, Nora, if you only could realize what my
      old home was really like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to realize any home different from this," said the girl, a
      cloud shading her bright eyes for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are silly and prejudiced," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan. "It is a great
      trial to me to have a daughter so unsympathetic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mummy! I don't mean to be unsympathetic. There now, we are quite cozy
      together. Tell me one of the old stories; I do so love to listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      The frown cleared from Mrs. O'Shanaghgan's forehead, and the peevish lines
      went out of her face. She began to talk with animation and excitement.
      Nora knew exactly what she was going to say. She had heard the story so
      often; but, although she had heard it hundreds and thousands of times, she
      was never tired of listening to the history of a trim life of which she
      knew absolutely nothing. The orderly, well-dressed servants, the punctual
      meals, the good and abundant food, the nice dresses, the parties, the
      solid education, the discipline so foreign to her own existence, all&mdash;all
      held their proper fascination. But although she listened with delight to
      these stories of a bygone time, she never envied her mother those periods
      of prosperity. Such a life would have been a prison to her; so she
      thought, although she never spoke her thought aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan began the old tale to-night, telling it with a little
      more <i>verve</i> even than usual. She ended at last with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the beautiful old times!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you didn't know father then," answered Nora, a frown coming to her
      brows, and an angry feeling for a moment visiting her warm heart. "You
      didn't have father, nor Nora, nor Terry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not, darling, and you make up for much; but, Nora dear,
      although I love my husband and my children, I hate this country. I hate
      it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, mother," said Nora, with a look of pain. She started to her feet.
      At that moment loud, strong steps were heard in the hall; a hearty voice
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Light o' the Morning? Where have you hidden yourself, witch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's father," said Nora. She said the words with a sort of gasp of
      rejoicing, and the next moment had dashed out of the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. &mdash; "SOME MORE OF THE LAND MUST GO."
    </h2>
    <p>
      Squire O'Shanaghgan was a tall, powerfully built man, with deep-set eyes
      and rugged, overhanging brows; his hair was of a grizzled gray, very thick
      and abundant; he had a shaggy beard, too, and a long overhanging mustache.
      He entered the north parlor still more noisily than Nora had done. The
      dogs yelped with delight, and flung themselves upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down, Creena! down, Cushla!" he said. "Ah, then, Nora, they are as
      bewitching as yourself, little woman. What beauties they are growing, to
      be sure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reared them," said Nora. "I am proud of them both. At one time I
      thought Creena could not live; but look at her now&mdash;her coat as black
      as jet, and so silky."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut the door, won't you, Patrick?" said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me! I forgot," said the Squire. He crossed the room, and, with an
      effort after quietness, closed the door with one foot; then he seated
      himself by his wife's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better, Eileen?" he said, looking at her anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you would not call me Eileen," she said. "I hate to have my name
      Irishized."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire's eyes filled with suppressed fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but you are half-Irish, whether you like it or not," he said. "Is not
      she, colleen? Bless me, what a day it has turned out! We are getting
      summer weather at last. What do you say to going for a drive, Eileen&mdash;Ellen,
      I mean? Black Bess is eating her head off in the stables. I want to go as
      far as Murphy's place, and you might as well come with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I too?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, child. Why not? You run round to the stables, Norrie, and
      give the order."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora instantly left the room, the dogs following her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ails her?" said the Squire, looking at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ails her, Pat? Nothing that I know of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you know very little," was his answer. "I never see that sort of
      anxious frown between the colleen's brows without knowing there's mischief
      in the wind. Somebody has been worrying her, and I won't have it." He put
      down his great hand with a thump on the nearest table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, Pat. You quite shatter my nerves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless you and your nerves, Ellen. I want to give them all possible
      consideration; but I won't have Light o' the Morning worried."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll spoil that girl; you'll rue it yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless her heart! I couldn't spoil her; she's unspoilable. Did you ever
      see a sweeter bit of a thing, sound to the core, through and through?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet or not," said the mother, "she has got to learn her lesson of life;
      and it is no good to be too tender with her; she wants a little bracing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been trying that on&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, not exactly, Pat; but you cannot expect me to keep all our troubles
      to ourselves. There's that mortgage, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bother the mortgage!" said the Squire. "Why do you harp on things the way
      you do? I'll manage it right enough. I am going round to see Dan Murphy
      now; he won't be hard on an old friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but have you not to pay up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some day, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now listen, Patrick. Do be reasonable. Whenever I speak of money you
      fight shy of the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't&mdash;I don't," said the Squire restlessly; "but I am dead tired.
      I have had a ride of thirty miles; I want my tea. Where is Nora? Do you
      mind my calling her? She'll order Pegeen to bring the tea here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I won't have it. We'll have tea in the dining room presently. I
      thought you objected to afternoon tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I do, as a rule; but I am mighty dhry&mdash;thirsty, I mean, Ellen.
      Well, all the better; I'll get more to drink in the dining room. Order the
      tea as soon as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ring the bell, Patrick."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire strode to the mantelpiece, pulled a bell-cord which hung from
      the ceiling, a distant bell was heard ringing in noisy fashion, and a
      moment afterward Pegeen put in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come right in, Margaret," said her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw! then, I'm sorry, ma'am, I forgot," said the girl. She came in, hiding
      both her hands under her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan uttered an impatient sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is impossible to train these creatures," she said under her breath.
      Aloud, she gave her order in quiet, impassive tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tea as soon as possible in the west parlor, and sound the gong when it is
      ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, wasn't I getting it?" said Pegeen. She left the room, leaving
      the door wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just like them," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan. "When you want the door open
      they invariably shut it, and when you want it shut they leave it open."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They do that in England too, as far as I can tell," said the Squire, with
      a slightly nettled tone in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now, Patrick, while we have a few moments to ourselves, I want to
      know what you mean to do about that ten thousand pounds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure, Ellen, it is more than I can tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will have to pay it, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so, some day. I'll speak to Dan to-night. He is the last man to
      be hard on a chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some more of the land must go," said the wife in a fretful tone. "Our
      rent-roll will be still smaller. There will be still less money to educate
      Terence. I had set my heart on his going to Cambridge or Oxford. You quite
      forget that he is eighteen now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cambridge or Oxford!" said the Squire. "Not a bit of it. My son shall
      either go to Old Trinity or he does without a university education.
      Cambridge or Oxford indeed! You forget, Ellen, that the lad is my son as
      well as yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't; but he is half an Englishman, three parts an Englishman,
      whatever his fatherhood," said the Squire's wife in a tone of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well! he is Terence O'Shanaghgan, for all that, and he will inherit
      this old place some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much there will be for him to inherit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eager steps were heard on the gravel, and the next instant Nora entered by
      the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have given the order," she said; "Angus will have the trap round in a
      quarter of an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right, my girl; you didn't let time drag," said her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angus wants you and mother to be quite ready, for he says Black Bess is
      nearly off her head with spirit. Now, then, mother, shall I go upstairs
      and bring down your things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind if you do, Nora; my back aches a good bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll put the air-cushion in the trap," said the Squire, who,
      notwithstanding her fine-lady airs, had a great respect and admiration for
      his wife. "We'll make you right cozy, Ellen, and a rattle through the air
      will do you a sight of good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I drive, father?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, little one? Suppose you bring Black Bess down on her knees? That
      horse is worth three hundred pounds, if she's worth a penny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I would?" said the girl reproachfully. "Now, dad, that is
      about the cruelest word you have said to your Nora for many a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and give me a hug, colleen," said the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora ran to him, clasped her arms round his neck, and kissed him once or
      twice. He had moved away to the other end of the room, and now he looked
      her full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are fretting about something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I&mdash;not I," said the girl; but she flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, colleen," said the Squire; "if it is that bit of a
      mortgage, you get it right out of your head. It's not going to worry <i>me</i>.
      I am going this very evening to have a talk with Dan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, if it is Dan Murphy you owe it to," said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, he's all right; he's the right sort; a chip of the old block&mdash;eh?
      He wouldn't be hard on a brother in adversity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wouldn't if he could help it," said Nora; but the cloud had not left
      her sensitive face. Then, seeing that father looked at her with intense
      anxiety, she made a valiant effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I believe in you," she said; "and, indeed, what does the loss
      of money matter while we are together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are! right you are!" said the Squire, with a laugh. He clapped
      her on the shoulder. "Trust Light o' the Morning to look at things in the
      right direction," he said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE WILD MURPHYS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Terence made his appearance at the tea table. In every respect he was a
      contrast to Nora. He was very good-looking&mdash;strikingly handsome, in
      fact; tall, with a graceful elegance of deportment which was in striking
      contrast to the burly figure of the old Squire. His face was of a
      nut-brown hue; his eyes dark and piercing; his features straight. Young as
      he was, there were the first indications of a black silky mustache on his
      short upper lip, and his clustering black curls grew in a high ridge off a
      lofty brow. Terence had the somewhat languid air which more or less
      characterized all his mother's movements. He was devoted to her, and took
      his seat now by her side. She laid her very thin and slender hand on his
      arm. He did not respond by look or movement to the gesture of affection;
      but had a very close observer been present he would have noticed that he
      drew his chair about the tenth of an inch nearer to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora and her father at the other end of the table were chattering volubly.
      Nora's face was all smiles; every vestige of that little cloud which had
      sat between her dark brows a few moments before had vanished. Her blue
      eyes were sparkling with fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire made brilliant sally after sally, to which she responded with
      all an Irish girl's aptitude for repartee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence and his mother conversed in low tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, mother," he was saying, "I had a letter from Uncle George this
      morning; he wants me to go next week. Do you think you can manage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long will you be away, Terence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know; a couple of months, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much money will it cost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall want an evening suit, and a new dress-suit, and something for
      everyday. These things are disgraceful," said the lad, just glancing at
      the frayed coat-sleeve, beneath which showed a linen cuff of immaculate
      whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence was always the personification of fastidiousness in his dress, and
      for this trait in his character alone Mrs. O'Shanaghgan adored him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have it," she said&mdash;"somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I must reply tonight," he continued. "Shall I ask the governor, or
      will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't worry him, Terry; I can manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her a little anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not going to sell any more of them?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a gold chain and that diamond ring; I never wear either. I would
      fifty times rather think that you were enjoying yourself with my relations
      in England. You are fitted to grace any society. Do not say another word,
      my boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the very best and noblest mother in the world," said the lad with
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Nora and her father continued their gay conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will take a basket with us," said Nora, "and Bridget shall give me a
      couple of dozen more of those little brown eggs. Mrs. Perch shall have a
      brood of chicks if I can manage it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust the girleen for that," said the Squire, and then they rose from
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ellen," he continued, addressing his wife, "have you and Terence done
      colloguing together? for I hear Black Bess coming to the front door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hasten, mother; hasten!" said Nora. "The mare won't stand waiting;
      she is so fresh she is just ready to fly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few moments witnessed a scene of considerable bustle. Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan, with all her English nerves, had plenty of pluck, and would
      scorn to show even a vestige of fear before the hangers-on, as she called
      the numerous ragged urchins who appeared from every quarter on each
      imaginable occasion. Although she was shaking from head to foot with
      absolute terror at the thought of a drive behind Black Bess, she stepped
      into her seat in the tall dog-cart without a remark. The mare fidgeted and
      half reared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoa! whoa! Black Bess, my beauty!" said the Squire. The groom, a
      bright-faced lad, with a wisp of yellow hair falling over his forehead,
      held firmly to the reins. Nora jumped up beside her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to drive?" asked that lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, mummy; you know I can. Whoa, Black Bess! it's me," said the girl.
      She took the reins in her capable little hands; the Squire sprang up
      behind, and Black Bess flew down the avenue as if on the wings of the
      wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan gave one hurried pant of suppressed anguish, and then
      sat perfectly still, her lips set, her hands tightly locked together. She
      endured these drives almost daily, but had never yet got accustomed to
      them. Nora, on the contrary, as they spun through the air, felt her
      spirits rising; the hot young blood coursed through her veins, and her
      eyes blazed with fun and happiness. She looked back at her father, who
      nodded to her briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it, Nora; keep her well in. Now that we are going uphill you can
      give her her head a bit. Whoa, Black Bess! Whoa!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The mare, after her first wild canter, settled into a more jog-trot gait,
      and the dog-cart did not sway so violently from side to side. They were
      soon careering along a wide, well-made road, which ran for many miles
      along the top of some high cliffs. Below them, at their feet, the wild
      Atlantic waves curled and burst in innumerable fountains of spray; the
      roar of the waves came up to their ears, and the breath of the salt
      breeze, the freshest and most invigorating in the world, fanned their
      cheeks. Even Mrs. O'Shanaghgan felt her heart beating less wildly, and
      ventured to put a question or two to Nora with regard to the clucking hen,
      Mrs. Perch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not forgotten the basket, mammy," said the girl; "and Hannah will
      put the eggs under the hen tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite certain that Hannah mismanaged the last brood," said Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan; "but everything goes wrong at the Castle just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother, hush! he will hear," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is just like you, Nora; you wish to keep&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come, now," said the Squire; "I hear the grumbles beginning. No
      grumbles when we are having our ride&mdash;eh, Ellen? I want you to come
      back with a hearty appetite for dinner, and a hearty inclination to sleep
      tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove faster and faster. Occasionally Nora touched the mare the
      faintest little flick with the end of her long whip. The creature
      responded to her touch as though girl and horse were one.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they drew up outside a dilapidated gate, one hinge of which was
      off. The Squire jumped down from his seat, came round, and held the
      horse's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoa! whoa!" he said. "Hullo, you, Mike! Why aren't you in your place?
      Come and open the gate this minute, lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      A small boy, with bare feet and ragged trousers, came hurrying, head over
      heels, down the road. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan shuddered and shut her eyes. The
      gate was swung open. Nora led the mare skillfully round a somewhat sharp
      corner, and the next instant they were dashing with headlong speed up a
      steep avenue. It was neglected; weeds grew all over it, and the adjacent
      meadows were scarcely distinguishable from the avenue itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire ran after the dog-cart, and leaped up while the mare was going
      at full speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well done, father!" called back Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven preserve us!" thought Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, who still sat speechless,
      and as if made of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they reached a long, rambling old house, with many small windows,
      interspersed with a few of enormous dimensions. These were called
      parliament windows, and had been put into many houses of that period in
      order to avoid the window-tax. Most of the windows were open, and out of
      some of them ragged towels were drying in the evening breeze. About half a
      dozen dogs, most of which were of mongrel breed, rushed forward at the
      sound of the wheels, barking vociferously. Nora, with a dexterous touch of
      her hand, drew the mare up just in front of the mansion, and then sprang
      lightly to her feet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, mother, shall I help you down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better find out first if Mrs. Murphy is in," said the Squire's
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ragged urchin, such as seemed to abound like mushrooms in the place,
      came and held the reins close to the horse's mouth. The creature stood
      trembling from the violence of her exertions, and pouring down moisture at
      every pore. "She wants to be well rubbed down," said the Squire. "She
      doesn't get half exercise enough; this will never do. What if I have to
      make money on her, and she is spoiled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The low words which came to his lips were not heard by anyone; there was a
      frown, very like Nora's own, between his brows. The next moment a small
      man, with reddish hair, in a very shabby suit of half-worn tweed, appeared
      on the steps of the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo, O'Shanaghgan, is that yourself?" he called out. "How are you, Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan? Right glad to see you. You'll step inside&mdash;won't you? I
      believe the wife is somewhere round. Neil, my man, go and look for the
      missus. Tell her that Madam O'Shanaghgan is here, and the Squire. Well,
      Nora, I suppose you are wanting a chat with Bridget? You won't find her
      indoors this fine evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is she, Mr. Murphy?" asked the girl. "I do want to have a talk with
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! what's the basket for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want her to give me some of the pretty brown eggs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go right down there by the sea-path, and you'll find her, as likely
      as not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," answered Nora. Slinging her basket on her arm, she started
      for her walk. As soon as she was out of sight she began to run. Presently
      she stopped and began whistling "The Wearing of the Green," which was
      responded to in a moment by another voice, sweet as that of a blackbird.
      She looked to right and left, and presently saw a pair of laughing black
      eyes looking down at her from beneath the shelter of a huge oak tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here I am. Will you climb up?" said the voice of Bridget Murphy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me a hand, and I'll be up with you in a moment," said Nora. She
      tossed her basket on the ground; a very firm, little brown hand was
      extended; and the next moment the girls were seated side by side on a
      stout branch of the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and what has brought you along here?" said Bridget.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came with father and mother in the dog-cart," replied Nora. "Father let
      me drive Black Bess. I had a jolly time; but she did pull a bit&mdash;my
      wrists are quite stiff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad you have come," said the other girl. "I was having a concert
      all by myself. I can imitate the thrush, the blackbird, and most of the
      birds round here. Shall I do the thrush for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Nora could speak she began imitating the full liquid notes of the
      bird to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I declare you have a genius for it," said Nora. "But how are you
      yourself, Biddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What should ail me?" replied Biddy. "I never had a care nor a worry nor a
      trouble yet; the day is long, and my heart is light. I am at peace, and I
      never had an ache in my body yet. But what is up with you, Nora alannah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's that mortgage, you know," said Nora, dropping her voice. "What is
      your father going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the mortgage," said Bridget. "Mr. Morgan came down from Dublin
      yesterday; he and father had a long talk. I don't know. I believe there's
      worry in the air, and when there is I always steer clear of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father, you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell you; don't question me. I am glad you have come. Can't you
      stay for the night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I can't. I must go back with father and mother. The fact is this,
      Bridget, I believe your father would do anything in the world for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose he would. What do you want to coax out of me now? Oh, Nora
      alannah! don't let us talk of worries. Come down to the sea with me&mdash;won't
      you? I have found the most lovely cave. I mean to explore it with
      lanterns. You go into the cave, and you can walk in nearly half a mile;
      and then it takes a sudden turn to the right, and they say there's an
      entrance into another cave, and just beyond that there's a ghost supposed
      to be. Some people say it is the home of the O'Shanaghgans' Banshee; but
      whatever it is, I mean to see all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean the Sea-Nymphs' Cave?" said Nora. "But you can only get to
      that by crossing the bay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Well, I am going tomorrow night; the moon is at the full. You will
      come over and go with me&mdash;won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I wish I could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why can't you? Don't let us worry about fathers and mothers. We're a
      pair of girls, and must have our own larks. There's Neil and there's Mike;
      they will get the boat all ready, and we can start off for the cave just
      when the tide is high; we can only get in then. We'll run the boat in as
      far as it will go, and we'll see what we'll see. You will come&mdash;won't
      you, Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like it of all things in the world," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why not? You can come over tomorrow afternoon, and stay the night
      here. Just say that I have asked you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But mother does not much like my sleeping out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that she does not like you to sleep at the house of the wild
      Murphys&mdash;that's what you mean, Nora. Then, get away; I don't want to
      force my company on you. I am as good as any other girl in Ireland; I have
      the blood of the old Irish kings in my veins; but if you are too proud to
      come, why&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not, and you know it," said Nora; "but mother is an Englishwoman,
      and she thinks we are all a little rough, you and I into the bargain. All
      the same, I'll come to-morrow. I do want to explore that cave. Yes, I'll
      come if you give me a proper invitation before mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mercy me!" said the girl, "must I go back to the house? I am so
      precious shabby, and your lady-mother has got such piercing eyes. But
      there, we can smuggle in the back way. I'll go up to my room and put on my
      bits of finery. Bedad! but I look as handsome as the best when I am
      dressed up. Come along, Nora; we'll get in the back way, and I'll give the
      invitation in proper style."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE INVITATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bridget and Nora began to climb up a very steep and narrow winding path.
      It was nothing more than a grass path in the midst of a lot of rock and
      underwood, but the girls were like young chamois, and leaped over such
      obstacles with the lightness of fawns. Presently they arrived at the back
      entrance of Cronane, the Murphys' decidedly dilapidated residence. They
      had to cross a courtyard covered with rough cobbles and in a sad state of
      neglect and mess. Some pigs were wallowing in the mire in one corner, and
      a rough pony was tethered to a post not far off; he was endeavoring, with
      painful insistence, to reach a clump of hay which was sticking out of a
      hayrick a foot or two away. Nora, seeing his wistful eyes, sprang forward,
      pulled a great handful of the hay, and held it to his mouth. The little
      creature almost whinnied with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are," said Bridget. "What right have you to give our hay to
      that pony?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nonsense," said Nora; "the heart in him was starving." She flung her
      arms round the pony's neck, pressed a kiss on his forehead, and continued
      to cross the yard with Biddy. Two or three ragged urchins soon impeded
      their path; one of them was the redoubtable Neil, the other Mike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it to-morrow night you want the boat, Miss Biddy?" said Neil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridget dropped her voice to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Neil," she said, "mum's the word; you are not to let it out to
      a soul. You and Mike shall come with us, and Miss Nora is coming too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Neil cast a bashful and admiring glance at handsome Nora, as she stood
      very erect by Biddy's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, miss," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At ten o'clock," said Bridget; "have the boat in the cove then, and we'll
      be down there and ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they say, miss, that the Banshee is out on the nights when the moon
      is at the full."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The O'Shanaghgans' Banshee," said Biddy, glancing at Nora, whose face did
      not change a muscle, although the brightness and wistfulness in her eyes
      were abundantly visible. She was saying to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would give all the world to speak to the Banshee alone&mdash;to ask her
      to get father out of his difficulty."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was half-ashamed of these thoughts, although she knew and almost
      gloried in the fact that she was superstitious to her heart's core.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Biddy soon entered the house by the back entrance, and ran up some
      carpetless stairs to Biddy's own room. This was a huge bedroom, carpetless
      and nearly bare. A little camp-bed stood in one corner, covered by a
      colored counterpane; there was a strip of carpet beside the bed, and
      another tiny strip by a wooden washhand-stand. The two great parliament
      windows were destitute of any curtain or even blind; they stared blankly
      out across the lovely summer landscape as hideous as windows could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a perfect summer's evening; but even now the old frames rattled and
      shook, and gave some idea of how they would behave were a storm abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddy, who was quite accustomed to her room and never dreamed that any
      maiden could sleep in a more luxurious chamber, crossed it to where a huge
      wooden wardrobe stood. She unlocked the door, and took from its depths a
      pale-blue skirt trimmed with quantities of dirty pink flounces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you are not going to put <i>that</i> on," said Nora, whose own
      training had made her sensitive to incongruity in dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am," said Biddy. "How can I see your lady-mother in this style of
      thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She went and stood in front of Nora with her arms akimbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look," she said, "my frock has a rent from here to here, and this
      petticoat is none of the best, and my stockings&mdash;well, I know it is
      my own fault, but I <i>won't</i> darn them, and there is a great hole just
      above the heel. Now, this skirt will hide all blemishes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what will your mother say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless her!" said Biddy, "she won't even notice. Here, let's whip on the
      dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hastily divested herself of her ragged cotton skirt, and put on the
      pale blue with the dirty silk flounces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you looking so grave for?" she said, glancing up at Nora. "I
      declare you're too stately for anything, Nora O'Shanaghgan! You stand
      there, and I know you criticise me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I love you too much," replied Nora. "You are Biddy Murphy, one of my
      greatest friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, it's sweet to hear her," said Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, all the same," continued Nora, "I don't like that dress, and it's
      terribly unsuitable. You don't look ladylike in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ladylike, and I with the blood of&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't begin that," said Nora; "every time I see you you mention that
      fact. I have not the slightest doubt that the old kings were ruffians, and
      dressed abominably."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you dare," said Biddy. She rushed up to the bed, dragged out her
      pillow, and held it in a warlike attitude. "Another word about my
      ancestors, and this will be at your devoted head!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora burst into a merry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, now, that's better," said Biddy. She dropped the pillow and
      proceeded with her toilet. The dirty skirt with its tawdry flounces was
      surmounted by a bodice of the same material, equally unsuitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddy brushed out her mop of jet-black hair, which grew in thick curls all
      over her head and stood out like a mop round her shoulders. She was a
      plain girl, with small, very black eyes, a turned-up nose, and a wide
      mouth; but there was an irresistible expression of drollery in her face,
      and when she laughed, showing her milk-white teeth, there were people who
      even thought her attractive. Nora really loved her, although the two,
      standing side by side, were, as far as appearances were concerned, as the
      poles asunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, come along," said Biddy. "I know I look perfectly charming. Oh, what
      a sweet, sweet blue it is, and these ducky little flounces! It was Aunt
      Mary O'Flannagan sent me this dress at Christmas. She wore it at a fancy
      ball, and said it might suit me. It does, down to the ground. Let me drop
      a courtesy to you, Nora O'Shanaghgan. Oh, how proper we look! But I don't
      care! Now I'm not afraid to face anyone&mdash;why, the old kings would
      have been proud of me. Come along&mdash;do."
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught Nora's hand; they dashed down the wide, carpetless stairs,
      crossed a huge hall, and entered a room which was known as the drawing
      room at Cronane. It was an enormous apartment, but bore the same traces of
      neglect and dirt which the whole of the rest of the house testified to.
      The paper on the walls was moldy in patches, and in one or two places it
      had detached itself from the wall and fell in great sheets to the ground.
      One loose piece of paper was tacked up with two or three huge tacks, and
      bulged out, swaying with the slightest breeze. The carpet, which covered
      the entire floor, was worn threadbare; but, to make up for these defects,
      there were cabinets of the rarest and most exquisite old china, some of
      the pieces being worth fabulous sums. Vases of the same china adorned the
      tall marble mantelpiece, and stood on brackets here and there about the
      room. There were also some exquisite and wonderfully carved oak, a Queen
      Anne sofa, and several spindle-legged chairs. An old spinet stood in a
      distant window, and the drab moreen curtains had once been handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing on the hearth, with his elbow resting on the marble mantelpiece
      close to a unique vase of antique design, stood Squire O'Shanaghgan. He
      was talking in pleasant and genial tones to Mrs. Murphy, a podgy little
      woman, with a great likeness to Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Murphy wore a black alpaca dress and a little three-cornered knitted
      shawl across her shoulders. She had gray hair, which curled tightly like
      her daughter's; on top of it was a cap formed of rusty black velvet and
      equally rusty black lace. She looked much excited at the advent of the
      Squire, and her cheeks testified to the fact by the brightness of their
      color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Murphy was doing penance opposite to Mrs. O'Shanaghgan. He was
      dreadfully afraid of that stately lady, and was glancing nervously round
      at his wife and the Squire from moment to moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam," he was saying, "it's turnips we are going to plant in that
      field just yonder. We have had a very good crop of hay too. It is a fine
      season, and the potatoes promise to be a sight for sore eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate the very name of that root," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan in her most
      drawling tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, ma'am, you don't say so," answered Murphy; "it seems hard on
      the poor things that keep us all going. The potheen and the potatoes&mdash;what
      would Ireland be without 'em? Glory be to goodness, it's quite awful to
      hear you abusing the potato, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am English, you know," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this scene Nora and Biddy entered. Mr. Murphy glanced with intense
      relief at his daughter. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan slightly raised her brows. It
      was the faintest of movements, but the superciliousness of the action
      smote upon Nora, who colored painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddy, taking her courage in her hand, went straight up to the august
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan extended her hand with a limp action.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear!" panted Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is up, my dear Bridget?" said her mother, turning round and looking
      at her daughter. "Oh, to goodness, what have you put that on for? It's
      your very best Sunday-go-to-meeting dress, and you won't have another, I
      can tell you, for six months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There now, mother, hush, do," said Biddy. "I have put it on for a
      purpose. Why, then, it's sweet I want to make myself, and I believe it's
      sweet I look. Oh, there's the mirror; let me gaze at myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the room, and stood in front of a long glass, examining her
      unsuitable dress from the front and side; and then, being thoroughly
      satisfied with the elegance of appearance, she went back and stood in
      front of Mrs. O'Shanaghgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a request I want to make of you, ma'am," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Biddy, I will listen to it if you will ask me properly," said Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to be sure," said Biddy. "How shall I say it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak quietly, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Biddy, I do wish you would take pattern by Nora, and by Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan," said Mrs. Murphy, who in her heart of hearts envied Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan's icy manners, and thought them the most perfect in all the
      world. She was in mortal fear of this good lady, even more terrified of
      her than her husband was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Biddy," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May Nora come and spend tomorrow night here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," was on Mrs. O'Shanaghgan's lips; but just then the Squire came
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure she may; it will do her a sight of good. The child hardly ever
      goes from home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan raised displeased eyes to her husband's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girls of Nora's age ought to stay at home," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to be sure, to be sure," said the Squire; "and we would miss her
      awfully if she was away from us; but a day or two off duty&mdash;eh,
      madam?" He glanced at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have your answer, Biddy," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan; "her father wishes
      Nora to accept your invitation. She may stay away for one night&mdash;no
      longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddy winked broadly round at Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then," she said, "come along." She seized her friend by the arm, and
      whisked her out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the dress that did it," she said; "it is the loveliest garment in
      all the world. Come along now, and let's take it off. I want to gather
      those eggs for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran upstairs again, followed by Nora. The dress was disposed of in the
      large wooden wardrobe, the old torn frock readjusted on Biddy's stout
      form, and the girls went out into the lovely summer air. The eggs which
      Nora required were put into the little basket, and in half an hour the
      O'Shanaghgans' party were returning at full speed to Castle O'Shanaghgan.
      Nora glanced once into her father's face, and her heart gave a great leap.
      Her high spirits left her as if by magic; she felt a lump in her throat,
      and during the rest of the drive hardly spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire, on the contrary, talked incessantly. He talked more than ever
      after Nora had looked at him. He slapped his wife on the shoulder, and
      complimented her on her bravery. Nora's driving was the very best in all
      the world; she was a born whip; she had no fear in her; she was his own
      colleen, the Light o' the Morning, the dearest, sweetest soul on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghan replied very briefly and coldly to her husband's excited
      words. She treated them with what she imagined the contempt they deserved;
      but Nora was neither elated just then by her father's praise nor chilled
      by her mother's demeanor. Every thought of her heart, every nerve in her
      highly strung frame, was concentrated on one fact alone&mdash;she had
      surprised a look, a look on the Squire's face, which told her that his
      heart was broken.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. &mdash; "I AM ASHAMED OF YOU."
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late that same evening, and the household at the Castle had all
      retired to rest. Nora was in her own room. This room was not furnished
      according to an English girl's fancy. It was plain and bare, but, compared
      to Biddy Murphy's chamber, it was a room of comfort and even luxury. A
      neat carpet covered the floor, there were white dimity curtains to the
      windows, and the little bed in its distant recess looked neat and
      comfortable. It is true that the washhand-stand was wooden, and the basin
      and jug of the plainest type; but Mrs. O'Shanaghgan herself saw that Nora
      had at least what she considered the necessaries of life. She had a neat
      hanging-press for her dresses, and a pretty chest of drawers, which her
      mother herself had saved up her pin-money to buy for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora now stood by one of the open windows, her thick and very long black
      hair hanging in a rippling mass over her neck and shoulders. Suddenly, as
      she bent out of the window, the faint, very faint perfume of a cigar came
      up on the night air. She sniffed excitedly for a moment, and then, bending
      a little more forward, said in a low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that you, Terry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;why don't you go to bed?" was the somewhat ungracious response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sleepy. May I come down and join you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come up and join me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was about to be "No"; there was a moment's hesitation, then
      Nora's voice said pleadingly, "Ah, do now, Terry; I want to say something
      so badly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if anybody hears?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They can't hear. Father and mother's room is at the other end of the
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right; don't say any more; you'll wake people with that chatter of
      yours. I'm coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a couple of minutes there was a knock at Nora's door. She flew to open
      it, and Terence came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To talk to you; I have got something to say. Come over and sit by the
      window."
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first thing to do is to put out that light," said Nora. She ran to
      the dressing table, and before her brother could prevent her had
      extinguished the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then, there is the dear old lady moon to look down upon us, and
      nothing else can see us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you go to bed, Nora? Hannah would say that you are losing your
      beauty-sleep sitting up at this, hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if anything about me mattered just now," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what's up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old thing, Terry; you must know what's up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What old thing? I am sure I can't guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, if you can't you ought. Father is in a peck of trouble&mdash;a
      peck of trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora's voice broke and trembled. Terence, who disliked a scene beyond
      anything, fidgeted restlessly. He leaned out of the window, and dropped
      his cigar ash on the ground beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are his only son and the heir to Castle O'Shanaghgan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The heir to a pack of ruins," said the boy impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terry, you don't deserve to be father's son. How dare you speak like that
      of the&mdash;the beloved old place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Nora, if you are going into heroics I think I'll be off to
      bed," said Terence, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you won't; you must listen. I have got something most important to
      say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I will give you five minutes; not another moment. I know you,
      Nora; you always exaggerate things. You are an Irishwoman to your
      backbone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am, and I glory in the fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to be ashamed to glory in it. Don't you want to have anything
      to do with mother and her relations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love my mother, but I am glad I don't take after her," said Nora; "yes,
      I am glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon shone on the two young faces, and Nora looked up at her brother;
      he put on a supercilious smile, and folded his arms across his broad
      chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she replied; "and I should like to shake you for looking like that.
      I am glad I am Irish through and through and <i>through</i>. Would I give
      my warm heart and my enthusiasm for your coldness and deliberation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good gracious, Nora, what a little ignorant thing you are! Do you suppose
      no Englishman has enthusiasm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll drop the subject," said Nora. "It is one I won't talk of; it puts
      me into such a boiling rage to see you sitting like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence did not speak at all for a moment; then he said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this thing that you have got to tell me? The five minutes are
      nearly up, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, bother your five minutes! I cannot tell you in five minutes. When my
      heart is scalded with unshed tears, how can I measure time by <i>minutes</i>?
      It has to do with father; it is worse than anything that has ever gone
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Norrie?" Her brother's tone had suddenly become gentle. He
      laid his hand for a moment on her arm; the gentleness of the tone, the
      unexpected sweetness of the touch overcame Nora; she flung her arms
      passionately round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, and you are the only brother I have got!" she sobbed; "and I could
      love you&mdash;I could love you like anything. Can't you be sympathetic?
      Can't you be sweet? Can't you be dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come, come!" said Terence, struggling to release himself from Nora's
      entwining arms; "I am not made like you, you know; but I am not a bad chap
      at heart. Now, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will try and tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for goodness' sake don't look so sorrowfully at me, Nora; we can
      talk, and we can act and do good deeds, without giving ourselves away. I
      hate girls who wear their hearts on their sleeves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! you will <i>never</i> understand," said Nora, starting back again;
      all her burst of feeling turned in upon herself. "I can't imagine how you
      are father's son," she began. But then she stopped, waited for a moment,
      and then said quietly, "There is a fresh mortgage, and it is for a very
      big sum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, is that all?" said Terence. "I have heard of mortgages all my life;
      it seems to be the fashion at O'Shanaghgan to mortgage to any extent.
      There is nothing in that; father will give up a little more of the land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much land do you think is left?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure I can't say; not much, I presume."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my impression," said Nora&mdash;"I am not sure; but it is my
      impression&mdash;that there is <i>nothing</i> left to meet this big thing
      but the&mdash;the&mdash;the land on which"&mdash;her voice broke&mdash;"Terry,
      the land on which the house stands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Nora, you are so melodramatic. I don't know how you can know
      anything of this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only guess. Mother is very unhappy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother? Is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I have touched you there! But anyhow, father is in worse trouble than
      he has been yet; I never, <i>never</i> saw him look as he did tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if looks mattered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The look I saw tonight does matter," said Nora. "We were coming home from
      Cronane, and I was driving."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is madness to let you drive Black Bess," interrupted Terence. "I
      wonder my father risks spoiling one of his most valuable horses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nonsense, Terry; I can drive as well as you, and better, thanks,"
      replied Nora, much nettled, for her excellent driving was one of the few
      things she was proud of. "Well, I turned round, and I saw father's face,
      and, oh! it was just as if someone had stabbed me through the heart. You
      know, or perhaps you don't, that the last big loan came from Squire
      Murphy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Dan Murphy; then we are as safe as we can be," said Terence, rising
      and whistling. "You really did make me feel uncomfortable, you have such a
      queer way; but if it is Dan Murphy, he will give father any amount of
      time. Why, they are the best of friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, father went to see him on the subject&mdash;I happen to know that&mdash;and
      I don't think he has given him time. There is something wrong, anyhow&mdash;I
      don't know what; but there <i>is</i> something very wrong, and I mean to
      find out tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora, if I were you I wouldn't interfere. You are only a young girl, and
      these kind of things are quite out of your province. Father has pulled
      along ever since you and I were born. Most Irish gentlemen are poor in
      these days. How can they help it? The whole country is going to ruin;
      there is no proper trade; there is no proper system anywhere. The tenants
      are allowed to pay their rent just as they please&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if we could harry them," said inconsistent Nora. "The poor dears, with
      their tiny cots and their hard, hard times. I'd rather eat dry bread all
      my days than press one of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If these are your silly views, you must expect our father to be badly
      off, and the property to go to the dogs, and everything to come to an
      end," said the brother in a discontented tone. "But there, I say once more
      that you have exaggerated in this matter; there is nothing more wrong than
      there has been since I can remember. I am glad I am going to England; I am
      glad I am going to be out of it all for a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You going to England&mdash;you, Terry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Don't you know? Our Uncle George Hartrick has asked me to stay with
      him, and I am going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you can go? You can leave us just now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course; there will be fewer mouths to feed. It's a good thing
      every way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Uncle George is a rich man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean he lives in a big place, and has heaps and heaps of money," said
      Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot go to him <i>shabby</i>. What are you going to do for dress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother will manage that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother!" Nora leaped up from the window-ledge and stood facing her
      brother. "You have spoken to mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I have. Dear me, Nora, you are getting to be quite an
      unpleasant sort of girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have spoken to mother," repeated Nora, "and she has promised to help
      you? How will she do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence moved restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose she knows herself how she will do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will let her?" said Nora&mdash;"you, a man, will let her? You
      know she has no money; you know she has nothing but her little trinkets,
      and you allow her to sell those to give you pleasure? Oh, I am ashamed of
      you! I am sorry you are my brother. How can you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Nora, I won't be scolded by you. After all, I am your elder,
      and you are bound, at any rate, to show me decent outward respect. If you
      only mean to talk humbug of this sort I am off to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence rose from his place on the window-ledge, and, without glancing at
      Nora, left the room. When he did so she clasped her hands high above her
      head, and sat for a moment looking out into the night. Her face was
      quivering, but no tears rose to her wide-open eyes. After a moment she
      turned, and began very slowly to undress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will see the Banshee tomorrow, if it is possible," she whispered under
      her breath. "If ruin can be averted, it shall be. I don't mind leaving the
      place; I don't mind starving. I don't mind <i>anything</i> but that look
      on father's face. But father's heart shall not be broken; not while Nora
      O'Shanaghgan is in the world."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. &mdash; THE CAVE OF THE BANSHEE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock on the following evening two eager excited girls might have
      been seen stealing down a narrow path which led to Murphy's Cove. Murphy's
      Cove was a charming little semicircular bay which ran rather deeply into
      the land. The sand here was of that silvery sheen which, at low tide,
      shone like burnished silver. The cove was noted for its wonderful shells,
      producing many cowries and long shells called pointers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of her early youth Nora had explored the treasures of this
      cove, and had secured a valuable collection of shells, as well as very
      rare seaweeds, which she had carefully dried. Her mother had shown her how
      to make seaweeds and shells into baskets, and many of these amateur
      productions adorned the walls of Nora's bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the charm of these things had passed away, however; the time had come
      when she no longer cared to gather shells or collect seaweeds. She felt
      that she was turning very fast into a woman. She had all an Irish girl's
      high spirits; but she had, added to these, a peculiarly warm and sensitive
      heart. When those she loved were happy, no one in all the world was
      happier than Nora O'Shanaghgan; but when any gloom fell on the
      home-circle, then Nora suffered far more than anyone gave her credit for.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had passed an anxious day at home, watching her father intently,
      afraid to question him, and only darting glances at him when she thought
      he was not looking. The Squire, however, seemed cheerful enough, plodding
      over his land, or arranging about the horses, or doing the
      thousand-and-one small things which occupied his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan seemed to have forgotten all about the mortgage, and was
      eagerly discussing ways and means with Terence. Terence avoided Nora's
      eyes, and rode off early in the evening to see the nearest tailor. It was
      not likely that this individual could make a fitting suit for the young
      heir to O'Shanaghgan; but the boy must have something to travel in, and
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan gave implicit directions as to the London tailor whom he
      was to visit as soon as he reached the Metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For you are to look your best, and never to forget that you are my son,"
      was her rejoinder; and Terence forgot all about Nora's words on the
      previous evening. He was to start in two days' time. Even Nora became
      excited over his trip and in her mother's account of her Uncle Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you were going, Nora," said the mother. "I should be proud of you.
      Of course you are a little rough colt; but you could be trained;" and then
      she looked with sudden admiration at her handsome daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has a face in a thousand," she thought, "and she is absolutely
      unconscious of her beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o'clock Nora had started off in the pony-trap to visit her friend
      Biddy. The trap had been brought back by one of the numerous gossoons who
      abounded all over O'Shanaghgan, and Biddy and Nora had a few hours before
      the great secret expedition was to take place. And now the time had come.
      The girls had put on thick serge petticoats, short jackets, and little
      tight-fitting caps on their heads. There was always a breeze blowing round
      that extreme corner of the Atlantic. Never did the finest summer day find
      the waves calm there. Nora and Biddy had been accustomed to these waves
      since their earliest girlhood, and were not the least afraid. They stood
      now waiting in the little cove, and looking round wonderingly for the
      appearance of Mike and Neil upon the scene. They were to bring the boat
      with them. The girls were to wade through the surf to get into it, and
      Biddy was stooping down to take off her shoes and stockings for the
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear!" she cried. "Do you see that ugly bank of clouds just behind
      the moon? I hope my lady moon is not going to hide herself; we can do
      nothing in the cave if we have not light."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the cave is dark, surely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. But don't you know there is a break in the cliffs above, just in the
      center? And it is down there the moon sends its shafts when it is at the
      full; it is there the Banshee will meet us, if we are to see her at all.
      The shafts from the moon will only enter the cave at midnight. I have
      counted the times, and I know everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see the Banshee so badly," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't be frightened, then, Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frightened? No. Not of our own Banshee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say," began Biddy, "that if you see a spirit, and come face to face
      with it, you are good for&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you hold out during the year you have seen the spirit, you are good to
      live for another ten; but during that first year you are in extreme danger
      of dying. If you escape that fate, however, and are whole and sound, you
      will be quite safe to live for ten more years. They say nothing can send
      you out of the world; not sickness, nor accidents, nor fire, nor water;
      but the second year you are liable to an accident, and the year after to a
      misfortune; then in the fourth year your luck turns&mdash;in the fourth
      year you find gold, in the fifth year health, in the sixth year beauty.
      Oh, I would give anything to be beautiful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very well as you are, Biddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well as I am? What nonsense! Look at my turned-up nose." Here Biddy
      pressed her finger on the feature in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks very racy," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bedad, then, it does that," replied Biddy. "I believe I got it sound and
      safe from one of the old&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't go on," cried Nora. "I know what you are going to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why shouldn't I say it? You would be proud enough to be descended
      from&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I have a very fine descent of my own," answered Nora, with spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, if I was like you," began Biddy, "wouldn't I be proud, just? But
      dear, dear! there never were two Irish girls farther asunder as far as
      appearance goes. See here, let me describe myself, feature by feature. Oh,
      here's a clear pool. I can get a glimpse of myself in it. You come and
      look in too, Nora. Now, then, we can see ourselves. Oh, holy poker! it's
      cruel the difference between us. Here's my forehead low and bumpy, and my
      little nose, scarcely any of it, and what there is turned right up to the
      sky; and my wide mouth, and my little eyes, and my hair just standing
      straight up as rakish as you please. And look at you, with your elegant
      features and your&mdash;oh, but it's genteel you are!&mdash;and I love
      you, Nora alannah; I love you, and am not a bit jealous of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the impulsive girl threw her arms round her friend's neck and kissed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same," she added, "I wish those clouds were not coming up. It has
      been so precious hot all day that I should not be the least surprised if
      we had a thunderstorm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thunderstorm while we are in the cave would be magnificent," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does anything ever frighten you, Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think anything in nature could frighten me; but there are some
      things I am frightened at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Do tell me. I should like to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll keep it a secret&mdash;won't you, Biddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I will. When did I ever blaze out anything you told me? If I
      am plain, I am faithful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am afraid of <i>pain</i>," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pain! You? But I have seen you scratch yourself ever so deep and not so
      much as wink; and I mind that time when you twisted your ankle and you
      didn't even pretend you were hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is not that sort of pain. I am terrified of pain when it affects
      those I love. But there! don't ask me any more. Here are the boys; we'll
      jump into the boat and be off. Why, it is half-past ten, and it will take
      half-an-hour's good rowing to cross the bay, and then we have to enter the
      cave and&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like those clouds," said Biddy. "I wonder if it is safe to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Safe?" said Nora. "We must go. Mother won't allow me to spend another
      night here, and I shall lose my chance. I am determined to speak to the
      Banshee or die in the attempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      The splash of oars was now distinctly audible, and the next moment a
      four-oared gig swiftly turned the little promontory and shot with a rapid
      movement into the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said Biddy, running forward, "who's in the boat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A lad and a man now stood upright and motioned to the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Neil?" said Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neil could not come, Miss Biddy, so I'm taking his place," said the deep
      voice of a powerful-looking man. He had a black beard down to his waist,
      flashing black eyes, a turned-up nose, and a low forehead. A more bull-dog
      and ferocious-looking individual it would be hard to find. Biddy, however,
      knew him; he was Neil's father&mdash;Andy Neil, as he was called. He was
      known to be a lawless and ferocious man, and was very much dreaded by most
      of the neighbors around. Neither Nora nor Biddy, however, felt any reason
      to fear him and Nora said almost cheerfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      "As we are to have such a stiff row, it is just as well to have a man in
      the boat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, now, young ladies, come along, and don't keep me waiting," said
      Andy, rising and brandishing one of his oars in a threatening way.
      "There's a storm coming on, and I want to be out of this afore it
      overtakes us. Oh, glory be to goodness, there's a flash of lightning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a flash on the edge of the horizon, lighting up the thick bank
      of rapidly approaching clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora, had we better go tonight?" said Biddy. She had as little fear as
      her friend, but even she did not contemplate with pleasure a wild storm in
      the midst of the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man Neil looked gravely round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Och! good luck to ye now, young ladies; don't be kaping me waiting after
      the botheration of coming to fetch yez. Come along, and be quick about
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure," said Nora. She splashed bravely into the surf, for the boat
      could not quite reach the shore. The waves reached high above her pretty,
      rosy ankles as she stepped into the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddy followed in her wake; and then Nora, producing a rough towel, began
      to dry her feet. Both girls put on their shoes and stockings again in
      absolute silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neil had now faced the boat seaward, and with great sweeps with a pair of
      sculls was taking it out to sea. The tide was in their favor, and they
      went at a rapid rate. The man did not speak at all, and his face was in
      complete shadow. Nora breathed hard in suppressed excitement and delight.
      Biddy crouched at the bottom of the boat and watched the clouds as they
      came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I hadn't come," she muttered once or twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy Mike sat at the stern. The two girls had nothing whatever to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I take an oar, Andy?" said Nora at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can take a pair of oars and help you," said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it plazes you, miss." The man hastily stepped to the back of the boat.
      Nora took her place, and soon they were going at greater speed than ever.
      She was a splendid oarswoman, and feathered her oars in the most approved
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than the prescribed half-hour they reached the entrance to the
      great cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were safe. A hollow, booming noise greeted them as they came close.
      Andy bent forward and gave Nora a brief direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ship your oars now, miss. Aisy now; aisy now. Now, then, I'll take one
      pull; pull your left oar again. Now, here we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with animation. Nora obeyed him implicitly. They entered the
      shadow of the cave, and the next instant found themselves in complete
      darkness. The boat bobbed up and down on the restless water, and just at
      that instant a flash of vivid lightning illuminated all the outside water,
      followed by a crashing roar of thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The storm is on us; but, thank the Almighty, we're safe," said Mike, with
      a little sob. "I wish to goodness we hadn't come, all the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so do I," said Biddy; "it is perfectly awful being in a cave like
      this. What shall we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do!" said Neil. "Hould your tongues and stay aisy. Faix, it's the
      Almighty is having a bit of a talk; you stay quiet and listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      The four oars were shipped now, and the boat swayed restlessly up and
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't we going any farther?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not while this storm lasts. Oh, for goodness' sake, Nora, do stay quiet,"
      said Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andy now produced out of his pocket a box of matches and a candle. He
      struck a match, applied it to the candle, and the next moment a feeble
      flame shot up. It was comparatively calm within the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! that will light us a bit," said Andy. "The storm won't last long.
      It's well we got into shelter. Now, then, we'll do fine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't think," said Biddy, in a terrified tone, "that the cave will be
      be crashed in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glory be to Heaven, no, miss&mdash;we have cheated the storm coming
      here." The man smiled as he spoke, showing bits of broken teeth. His words
      were gentle enough, but his whole appearance was more like that of a wild
      beast than a man. Nora looked full at him. The candle lit up her pale
      face; her dark-blue eyes were full of courage; a lock of her black hair
      had got loose in the exertion of rowing, and had fallen partly over her
      shoulder and neck. "Faix, then, you might be the Banshee herself," said
      Andy, bending forward and looking at her attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the moon comes out again we may see the Banshee," whispered Nora. "Can
      we not go farther into the cave? Time is flying." She took her watch from
      her pocket and looked at the hour. It was already past eleven o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The storm will be over in good time," said the man. "Do you want to get
      the gleam of moonlight in the crack of the inner cave? Is that what you're
      afther, missy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you stay quiet; you'll reach it right enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora wants to see the Banshee, Andy," called out Biddy. "Oh, what a
      flash! It nearly blinded me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rain will soon be on us, and then the worst of the storm will be
      past," said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike uttered a scream; the lightning was now forked and intensely blue. It
      flashed into every cranny in the cave, showing the barnacles on the roof,
      the little bits of fern, the strange stalactites. After the flash had
      passed, the darkness which followed was so intense that the light of the
      dim candle could scarcely be seen. Presently the rain thundered down upon
      the bare rock above with a tremendous sound; there were great hailstones;
      the thunder became less frequent, the lightning less vivid. In a little
      more than half an hour the fierce storm had swept on to other quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then, we can go forward," said Andy. He took up his oars. "You had
      best stay quiet, missies; just sit there in the bottom of the boat, and
      let me push ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will hold the candle," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it into her cold fingers. Her heart was beating high with
      suppressed excitement; she had never felt a keener pleasure in her life.
      If only she might see the Banshee, and implore the spirit's intercession
      for the fortunes of her house!
    </p>
    <p>
      The man rowed on carefully, winding round corners and avoiding many
      dangers. At last they came bump upon some rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then," he said, "we can't go a step farther."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we must," said Nora. "We have not reached the chasm in the rock. We
      must."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We dare not, miss; the boat hasn't water enough to float her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I shall wade there. How far on is the chasm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Nora! Nora! you won't be so mad as to go alone?" called out Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shan't be a scrap afraid," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there's water up to your knees; you dare not do it," said Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I dare; and the tide is going down&mdash;is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be down a good bit in half an hour," said the man, "and we'll be
      stranded here as like as not. These are bad rocks when the tide is low; we
      must turn and get out of this, miss, in a quarter of an hour at the
      farthest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I could just do it in a quarter of an hour," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up, and the next moment had sprung out of the boat into the
      water, which nearly reached up to her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Nora! Nora! you'll be lost; you'll slip and fall in that awful
      darkness, and we'll never see you again," said Biddy, with a cry of
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; let her go," said Andy. "There ain't no fear, miss; you have but
      to go straight on, holding your candle and avoiding the rocks to your
      left, and you'll come to the opening. Be as quick as you can, Miss Nora;
      be as quick as you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice had a queer note in it. Nora gave him a look of gratitude, and
      proceeded on her dangerous journey. Her one fear was that the candle might
      go out; the flame flickered as the air got less good; the hot grease
      scalded her fingers; but suddenly a breeze of fresher air reached her, and
      warned her that she was approaching the aperture. There came a little puff
      of wind, and the next moment the brave girl found herself in total
      darkness. The candle had gone out. Just at that instant she heard, or
      fancied she heard, a splash behind her in the water. There was nothing for
      it now but to go forward. She resolved not to be terrified. Perhaps it was
      a water-rat; perhaps it was the Banshee. Her heart beat high; still she
      had no fear. She was going to plead for her father. What girl would be
      terrified with such a cause in view? She walked slowly and carefully on,
      and at last the fresher air was followed by a welcome gleam of light; she
      was approaching the opening. The next moment she had found it. She stood
      nearly up to her knees in the water; the shaft of moonlight was piercing
      down into the cave. Nora went and stood in the moonlight. The hole at the
      top was little more than a foot in width; there was a chasm, a jagged
      chasm, through which the light came. She could see a bit of cloudless sky,
      and the cold moonlight fell all over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Banshee!&mdash;Lady Spirit who belongs to our house, come and speak
      to me," cried the girl. "Come from your home in the rock and give me a
      word of comfort. A dark time is near, and we implore your help. Come,
      come, Banshee&mdash;it is the O'Shanaghgans who want you. It is Nora
      O'Shanaghgan who calls you now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of a laugh came from the darkness behind her, and the next
      instant the startled girl saw the big form of Andy Neil approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you be frightened, Miss Nora," he said. "I aint the Banshee, but I
      am as good. Faix, now, I want to say something to you. I have come here
      for the purpose. There! don't be frightened. I won't hurt ye&mdash;not I;
      but I want yez to promise me something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come here for the purpose. <i>She</i> aint no good." He indicated
      with a motion of his thumb the distant form of Biddy within the dark
      recess of the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does Miss Murphy know you have followed me?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she don't know it; she's in the dark. There's the little lad Mike
      will look after her. She won't do nothing until we go back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I did want to see the Banshee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Banshee may come or not," said the man; "but I have my message to
      yez, and it is this: If you don't get Squire O'Shanaghgan to let me keep
      my little bit of land, and to see that I aint evicted, why, I'll&mdash;you're
      a bonny lass, you're as purty a young lady as I ever set eyes on, but I'll
      drownd yez, deep down here in this hole. No one will ever know; they'll
      think you has fallen and got drowned without no help from me. Yes, I'll do
      it&mdash;yes, I will&mdash;unless you promises that Squire O'Shanaghgan
      shan't evict me. If I go out, why, you goes out first. Now, you'll do it;
      you'll swear that you'll do it? You'll leave no stone unturned. You'll get
      'em to leave me my cabin where I was born, and the childer was born, and
      where the wife died, or I'll drownd yez deep down here in the Banshee's
      hole. Look!" said the man as the moon nickered on a deep pool of water;
      "they say there is no bottom to it. Just one shlip, and over you goes, and
      nobody will ever see Nora O'Shanaghgan again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not going to be frightened; you wouldn't do it, Andy," said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't I just? You think that I'd be afraid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so. I am sure you are afraid of nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why shouldn't I do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you wouldn't be so bad, not to an innocent girl who never harmed
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! wouldn't I just? Ain't I a-stharving, and aint the childer stharving,
      and why should they turn us out of our bit of a cabin? Swear you'll do it;
      swear you won't have me evicted; you has got to promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> wouldn't evict you&mdash;never, never!" said Nora. "Oh, never!"
      she added, tears, not of fright, but of pity, filling her eyes. "But how
      can I control my father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's for you to see to, missy; I must go back now, or we'll none of us
      leave this cave alive. But you'll just shlip into that water, and you'll
      never be heard of again unless you promises. I'll go back; they none of
      'em will know I followed yez. You'll be drowned here in the deep pool, and
      I'll go back to the boat, or you promises and we both goes back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Andy, what am I to promise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you won't have me evicted. You say solemn here: 'Andrew Neil, I
      would rather die myself or have my tongue cut out, and may the Holy Mother
      cast me from her presence forever, and may the evil spirits take me, if I
      don't save you, Andy.' You has to say that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I won't," said Nora with sudden spirit. "I am not afraid. I'll do my
      very, very best for you; but I won't say words like those."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at her attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a little frightened at first," continued Nora; "but I am not now. I
      would rather you pushed me into that pool, I would rather sink and die,
      than take an awful vow like that. I won't take it. I'll do my very best to
      save you, but I won't make a vow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, then, miss, it's you that has the courage; but now if I let yez off
      this time, will ye do yer best?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'll do my best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If yer don't, bonny as you are, and the light of somebody's eyes, you'll
      go out of the world. But, come, I trust yez, and we must be turning back."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man took the matches from his pocket, struck one, and lit the candle.
      Then, Andy going in front of Nora, they both turned in the direction where
      the boat was waiting for them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. &mdash; THE MURPHYS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was between two and three in the morning when the girls found
      themselves back again in the desolate mansion of Cronane. Biddy had left a
      window open; they had easily got in by it and gone up to Biddy's big room
      on the first floor. They were to sleep together in Biddy's small bed.
      Personally, discomforts did not affect them; they had never been
      accustomed to luxury, and rather liked the sense of hardship than
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I brought up a bit of supper beforehand," said Biddy. "I am real hungry.
      What do you say to cold bacon and taters&mdash;eh? I went down to the
      larder and got a good few early this morning. I put them in the cupboard
      in a brown bowl with a plate over it. You're hungry&mdash;aren't you,
      Norrie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not very," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's come to you, you're so quiet? You have lost all your spirit. I
      thought we would have a real rollicking time over our supper, laughing and
      talking, and telling our adventures. Oh! it was awful in that cave; and
      when you were away talking to the lady Banshee I did have a time of it. I
      thought that awful Andy was going to murder me. I had a sort of feeling
      that he was getting closer and closer, and I clutched hold of little Mike.
      I think he was a bit surprised; I'll give him a penny to-morrow, poor
      gossoon. But aren't you hungry, and won't you laugh, and shan't we have a
      jolly spree?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I shall be very glad to eat something," said Nora; "and I am a little
      cold, too. I took a chill standing so long in that icy water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear, oh, dear! it's the rheumatics you'll be getting, and then
      you'll lose your beautiful straight figure. I must rub your legs. There,
      sit on the bed and I'll begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora submitted to Biddy's ministrations. The room was lit by a small dip
      candle, which was placed in an old tin candlestick on the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear! the light will be coming in no time, and we can quench the
      glim then," said Biddy. "I've got to be careful about candles. We're
      precious short of everything at Cronane just now. We're as poor as church
      mice; it's horrid to be so desperately poor as that. But, hurrah for the
      cold taters and bacon! We'll have a right good meal. That will warm you
      up; and I have a little potheen in a black bottle, too. I'll put some
      water to it and you shall have a drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never touch it," said Nora, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must tonight, or you'll catch your death of cold. There, the best
      thing you can do is to get right into bed. Why, you're shivering, and your
      teeth are chattering. It's a fine state Mrs. O'Shanaghgan will be in
      tomorrow when you go back to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must not get ill, Biddy; that would never do," said Nora, pulling
      herself together with an effort. "Yes, I'll get into bed; and I'll take a
      little of your potheen&mdash;very, very weak, if you'll mix it for me&mdash;and
      I'll have some of the bacon and potatoes. Oh! I would eat anything rather
      than be ill. I never was really ill in my life; but now, of all times, it
      would never do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, here you go. Tumble into bed. I'll pile the blankets on you.
      Now, isn't that better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddy bustled, intent on hospitality. She propped Nora up with pillows,
      pulled a great rug over her shoulders, and heaped on more and more
      blankets, which she pulled expeditiously from under the bed. "They always
      stay here in the summer," said Biddy. "That's to keep them aired; and now
      they're coming in very handy. You have got four doubled on you now; that
      makes eight. I should think you'd soon be warm enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect I shall soon be too hot," said Nora; "but this is very nice."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sipped the potheen, ate a little bacon and cold potatoes, and
      presently declared herself well again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am perfectly all right!" she said; "it was coming home in the boat
      in my wet things. I wish I had taken a pair of sculls again; then I
      wouldn't even have been cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you'll tell me," said Biddy, who sat on the edge of the bed munching
      great chunks of bacon and eating her cold potatoes with extreme relish.
      "Oh! it's hungry I am; but I want to hear all about the lady Banshee. Did
      she come? Did you see her, Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she didn't come," said Nora very shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't come? But they say she never fails when the moon is at the full.
      She rises up out of that pool&mdash;the bottomless pool it is called&mdash;and
      she floats over the water and waves her hand. It's awful to see her if you
      don't belong to her; but to those who belong to her she is tender and
      sweet, like a mother, they say; and her breath is like honey, and her kiss
      the sweetest you ever got in all your life. You mean to say you didn't see
      her? Why, Nora, what has come to you? You're trembling again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell you, Biddy; don't ask me any more. I didn't see the
      Banshee. It was very, very cold standing up to my knees in the water. I
      suppose I did wrong to go; but that's done and over now. Oh, I am so tired
      and sleepy! Do get into bed, Biddy, and let us have what little rest we
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning Nora returned to O'Shanaghgan. All trace of ill
      effects had vanished under Biddy's prompt treatment. She had lain under
      her eight blankets until she found them intolerable, had then tossed most
      of them off, and fallen into deep slumber. In the morning she looked much
      as usual; but no entreaties on the part of Biddy, joined in very heartily
      by Squire Murphy and also by Mrs. Murphy, could induce her to prolong her
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a message I'll take over myself to your father if you'll but stay,
      Nora," said the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; I must really go home," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too fine you are for us, Nora, and that's the truth; and don't go
      for to be denying it," said Mrs. Murphy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I hope I may never be too fine for my real friends," said Nora a
      little sadly. "I must go back. I believe I am wanted at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a very conceited colleen; there's no girl that can't be spared
      from home sometimes," said Mrs. Murphy. "I thought you would help Biddy
      and me to pick black currants. There are quarts and quarts of 'em in the
      garden, and the maids can't do it by themselves, poor things. Well, Biddy,
      you have got to help me today."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mammy, I just can't," answered Biddy. "I'm due down at the shore, and
      I want to go a bit of the way back with Nora. You can't expect me to help
      you today, mammy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There she is, Nora&mdash;there she is!" exclaimed the good lady, her face
      growing red and her eyes flashing fire; "not a bit of good, not worth her
      keep, I tell her. Why shouldn't she stay at home and help her mother? Do
      you hear me, Squire Murphy? Give your orders to the girl; tell her to stay
      at home and help her mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, don't be bothering me," said Squire Murphy. "It's out I'm going now.
      I have enough on my own shoulders without attending to the tittle-tattle
      of women."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the table, and the next moment had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear! there are bad times ahead for poor Old Ireland," said Mrs.
      Murphy. "Children don't obey their parents; husbands don't respect their
      wives; it's a queer state of the country. When I was young, and lived at
      my own home in Tipperary, we had full and plenty. There was a bite and a
      sup for every stranger who came to the door, and no one talked of money,
      nor thought of it neither. The land yielded a good crop, and the potatoes&mdash;oh,
      dear! oh, dear! that was before the famine. The famine brought us a lot of
      bad luck, that it did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the potatoes have been much better the last few years, and this year
      they say we're going to have a splendid crop," said Nora. "But I must go
      now, Mrs. Murphy. Thank you so much for asking me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're looking a bit pale; but you're a beautiful girl," said the good
      woman admiringly. "I'd give a lot if Biddy could change places with you&mdash;that
      is, in appearance, I mean. She's not a credit to anybody, with her bumpy
      forehead and her cocked nose, and her rude ways to her mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mammy, I really cannot help the way I am made," said Biddy; "and as to
      staying in this lovely day picking black currants and making jam, and
      staining my fingers, it's not to be thought of. Come along out, Nora. If
      you must be off back to O'Shanaghgan, I mean to claim the last few moments
      of your stay here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls spent the morning together, and early in the afternoon Nora
      returned to O'Shanaghgan. Terence met her as she was driving down the
      avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How late you are!" he said; "and you have got great black shadows under
      your eyes. You know, of course, that I have to catch the early train in
      the morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I do, Terry; and it is for that very reason I have come back
      so punctually. I want to pack your things my own self."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that's a good girl. You'll find most of them laid out on the bed. Be
      sure you see that all my handkerchiefs are there&mdash;two dozen&mdash;and
      all marked with my initials."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knew you had so many."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; mother gave me a dozen at Christmas, and I have not used them yet. I
      shall want every bit of decent clothing I possess for my visit to my rich
      Uncle Hartrick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is mother, Terence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother? Quite well, I suppose; she is fretting a bit at my going; you'll
      have to comfort her. The place is very rough for her just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see that it is any rougher than it has ever been," said Nora a
      little fiercely. "You're always running down the place, Terry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can't help it. I hate to see things going to the dogs," said the
      young man. He turned on his heel, called a small fox-terrier, who went by
      the name of Snap, to follow him, and went away in the direction of the
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora whipped up her pony and drove on to the house. Here she was greeted
      by her father. He was standing on the steps; and, coming down, he lifted
      her bodily out of the dog-cart, strained her to his heart, and looked full
      into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Light o' the Morning, I have missed you," he said, and gave a great
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl nestled up close to him. She was trembling with excess of
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I have missed you," she answered. "How is the mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose she is all right, Nora; but there, upon my word, she does vex
      me sometimes. Take the horse to the stables, and don't stand staring
      there, Peter Jones." The Squire said these latter words on account of the
      fixed stare of a pair of bright black eyes like sloes in the head of the
      little chap who had brought the trap for Nora. He whipped up the pony,
      turned briskly round, and drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come out for a bit with me round the grounds, Nora. It's vexed I am,
      sometimes; I feel I cannot stand things. I wish my lady would not have all
      those fine airs. But there, I have no right to talk against your mother to
      you, child; and of course she is your mother, and I am desperately proud
      of her. There never was her like for beauty and stateliness; but sometimes
      she tries me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I know, father; I know. But let's go round and look at the new calf
      and the colt. We can spare an hour&mdash;can we not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; come along quick, Nora," answered the Squire, all smiles and jokes
      once more. "The mother doesn't know you have come back, and we can have a
      pleasant hour to ourselves."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE SQUIRE'S TROUBLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nora and her father went slowly down a shady walk, which led in the
      direction of the shore. Soon they found themselves in a hay-field. The
      crop here was not particularly good. The hay had been spoiled by rains,
      which had soaked down on the lands a fortnight ago. It was stunted in
      height, and in some parts had that impoverished appearance which is so
      painful to the heart of the good farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire O'Shanaghgan, notwithstanding his somewhat careless ways, was
      really a capital farmer. He had the best interests of the land at heart,
      and did his utmost to get profit out of his many acres. He now shook his
      head over the hay-crop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just like all the rest, Norrie&mdash;everything going to ruin&mdash;the
      whole place going to the dogs; and yet&mdash;and yet, colleen, it's about
      the sweetest bit of earth in all God's world. I wouldn't give O'Shanaghgan
      for the grandest place in the whole of England; and I told your
      lady-mother so this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you say it, father? Had mother been&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing, child&mdash;nothing; the old grumbles. But it's her way,
      poor dear; she can't help herself; she was born so. It's not to be
      expected that she who was brought up in that prim land over yonder, where
      everything is cut and dry, and no one ever thinks of managing anything but
      by the rule of three, would take to our wild ways. But there, Norrie, it's
      the freedom of the life that suits me; when I am up and away on Black Bess
      or on Monarch, I don't think there is a happier fellow in the world. But
      there, when I come face to face with money, why, I'm bothered&mdash;I'm
      bothered entirely, child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," said Nora, "won't you tell me what is worrying you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know I am worried about anything, colleen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do I know, father?" answered Nora a little playfully. She turned and
      faced him. "I know," she said; "that is enough; you are worried. What is
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire looked at her attentively. He was much the taller of the two,
      and his furrowed face seemed to the girl, as she looked up at him, like a
      great rock rising above her. She was wont to sun herself in his smile, and
      to look to him always as a sure refuge in any perplexity. She did not love
      anyone in the whole world as she loved her father. His manliness appealed
      to her; his generous ways suited her; but, above all these things, he was
      her father; he was Irish to his backbone, and so was she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must tell me," she said. "Something is troubling you, and Nora has to
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my Light o' the Morning! what would I do without you?" answered the
      Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prove that you trust me," said Nora, "and tell me what worries you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Nora, you cannot understand; and yet if you could it would be a
      relief to unburden my mind. But you know nothing about mortgages&mdash;do
      you, little woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than you think," said Nora. "I am not a child&mdash;I am nearly
      seventeen; and I have not lived at O'Shanaghgan all my life for nothing.
      Of course we are poor! I don't know that I want to be rich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you what I want," said the Squire; "I want to forget that there
      is such a thing as money. If it were not for money I would say to myself,
      'There's not a better lot than mine.' What air we have here!" He opened
      his mouth and took in a great breath of the pure Atlantic breezes. "What a
      place it is! Look at the beauty of it! Look round, Norrie, and see for
      yourself; the mountains over there; and the water rolling up almost to our
      doors; and the grand roar of the waves in our ears; and those trees
      yonder; and this field with the sun on it; and the house, though it is a
      bit of a barrack, yet it is where my forebears were born. Oh, it's the
      best place on earth; it's O'Shanaghgan, and it's mine! There, Nora, there;
      I can't stand it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire dashed his hand to his brow. Nora looked up at him; she was
      feeling the exposure and excitement of last night. Her pallor suddenly
      attracted his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what's the matter with you, colleen?" he said. "Are you well&mdash;are
      you sure you're well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely, perfectly well, father. Go on&mdash;tell me all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you know, child, when I came in for the estate it was not to say
      free."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does that mean, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was my father before me&mdash;your grandfather&mdash;the best hunter
      in the county. He could take his bottle of port and never turn a hair; and
      he rode to hounds! God bless you, Nora! I wish you could have seen your
      grandfather riding to hounds. It was a sight to remember. Well, he died&mdash;God
      bless him!&mdash;and there were difficulties. Before he died those
      difficulties began, and he mortgaged some of the outer fields and Knock
      Robin Farm&mdash;the best farm on the whole estate; but I didn't think
      anything of that. I thought I could redeem it; but somehow, child, somehow
      rents have been going down; the poor folk can't pay, and I'm the last to
      press them; and things have got worse and worse. I had a tight time of it
      five years ago; I was all but done for. It was partly the fact of the
      famine; we none of us ever got over that&mdash;none of us in this part of
      Ireland, and many of the people went away. Half the cabins were deserted.
      There's half a mile of 'em down yonder; every single one had a dead man or
      woman in it at the time of the famine, and now they're empty. Well of
      course, you know all about that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, father; Hannah has told me of the famine many, many times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure&mdash;to be sure; but it is a dark subject, and not fit for a
      pretty young thing like you. But there, let me go on. It was five years
      ago I mortgaged some of the place, a good bit, to my old friend Dan
      Murphy. He lent me ten thousand pounds&mdash;not a penny more, I assure
      you. It just tided me over, and I thought, of course, I'd pay him back,
      interest and all, by easy stages. It seemed so easy to mortgage the place
      to Murphy, and there was nothing else to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire had been walking slowly; now he stopped, dropped Nora's hand
      from his arm, and faced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seemed so easy to mortgage the land to Dan Murphy," he said, dropping
      his voice, "so very easy, and that money was so handy, and I thought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, father?" said Nora in a voice of fear. "You said these words before.
      Go on&mdash;it was so easy. Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, a month ago, child, I got a letter from Murphy's lawyer in Dublin,
      to say that the money must be paid up, or they would foreclose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Foreclose, father. What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take possession, child&mdash;take possession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A month ago you got that letter? They would take possession&mdash;possession
      of the land you have mortgaged. Does that mean that it would belong to
      Squire Murphy, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I thought, my dear colleen, and I didn't fret much. The fact is, I put
      the letter in the fire and forgot it. It was only three days ago that I
      got another letter to know what I meant to do. I was given three months to
      pay in, and if I didn't pay up the whole ten thousand, with the five
      years' interest, they'd foreclose. I hadn't paid that, Nora; I hadn't paid
      a penny of it; and what with interest and compound interest, it mounted to
      a good round sum. Dan charged me six per cent, on the money; but there,
      you don't understand figures, child, and your pretty head shan't be
      worried. Anyhow, I was to pay it all up within the three months&mdash;I,
      who haven't even fifty pounds in the bank. It was a bit of a staggerer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," said Nora; "and that was why you went the day before
      yesterday to see Squire Murphy. Of course, he'll give you time; though,
      now I come to think of it, he is very poor himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is that," said the Squire. "I don't blame him&mdash;not a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what will you do, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must think. It is a bit of a blow, my child, and I don't quite see my
      way. But I am sure to, before the time comes; and I have got three
      months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But won't he let you off, father? Must you really pay it in three
      months?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God help me, Norrie! I can't, not just now; but I will before the time
      comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what did he say, father? I don't understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's this, Nora. Ah, you have a wise little head on your shoulders, even
      though you are an Irish colleen. He said that he had sold my mortgage to
      another man, and had got money on it; and the other man&mdash;he is an
      Englishman, curse him!&mdash;and he wants the place, Nora, and he'll take
      it in lieu of the mortgage if I don't pay up in three months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The place," said Nora; "O'Shanaghgan&mdash;he wants O'Shanaghgan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; that's it; he wants the land, and the old house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he can't," said Nora. "You have not&mdash;oh! you have not mortgaged
      the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless you, Nora! it is I that have done it; the house that you were born
      in, and that my father, and father before him, and father before him
      again, were born in, and that I was born in&mdash;it goes, and the land
      goes, the lake yonder, all these fields, and the bit of the shore; all the
      bonny place goes in three months if we cannot pay the mortgage. It goes
      for an old song, and it breaks my heart, Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," said Nora very gravely. She did not cry out; the tears
      pressed close to the back of her eyes, and scalded her with cruel pain;
      but she would not allow one of them to flow. She held her head very erect,
      and the color returned to her pale cheeks, and a new light shone in her
      dark-blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll manage somehow; we must," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking of that," said the Squire. "Of course we'll manage." He
      gave a great sigh, as if a load were lifted from his heart. "Of course
      we'll manage," he repeated; "and don't you tell your mother, for the life
      of you, child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I will tell nothing until you give me leave. But how do you
      mean to manage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am thinking of going up to Dublin next week to see one or two old
      friends of mine; they are sure to help me at a pinch like this. They would
      never see Patrick O'Shanaghgan deprived of his acres. They know me too
      well; they know it would break my heart. I was thinking of going up next
      week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why next week, father? You have only three months. Why do you put it
      off to next week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, you're right, colleen; but it's a job I don't fancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have got to do it, and you ought to do it at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure&mdash;to be sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me with you, father; let us go tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have not got money for us both. I must go alone; and then your
      mother must not be left. There's Terence gallivanting off to England to
      visit his fine relations, and that will take a good bit. I had to give him
      ten pounds this morning, and there are only forty now left in the bank.
      Oh, plenty to tide us for a bit. We shan't want to eat much; and there's a
      good supply of fruit and vegetables on the land; and the poor folk will
      wait for their wages. Of course there will be more rents coming in, and
      we'll scrape along somehow. Don't you fret, colleen. I declare it's light
      as a feather my heart is since I told you the truth. You are a comfort to
      me, Norrie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," said Nora suddenly, "there's one thing I want to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that, pet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know Andy Neil?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Andrew Neil&mdash;that scoundrel?" The Squire's brow grew very
      black. "Yes, yes. What about him? You have not seen him, have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, father, I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over at Murphy's? He knew he dare not show his face here. Well, what
      about him, Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," said Nora, trembling very much; "he&mdash;he does not want you to
      evict him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll pay his rent, or he'll go," thundered the Squire. "No more of this
      at present. I can't be worried."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, oh, father! he&mdash;he can't pay it any more than you can pay the
      mortgage. Don't be cruel to him if you want to be dealt with mercifully
      yourself; it would be such bad luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good gracious, Nora, are you demented? The man pays his rent, or he goes.
      Not another word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, dear father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not another word. Go in and see your mother, or she'll be wondering what
      has happened to you. Yes, I'll go off to Dublin to-morrow. If Neil doesn't
      pay up his rent in a week, off he goes; it's men like Andrew Neil who are
      the scum of the earth. He has put my back up; and pay his rent he will, or
      out he goes."

      CHAPTER IX. &mdash; EDUCATION AND OTHER THINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day the Squire and Terence went off together. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan
      was very angry with her husband for going, as she expressed it, to amuse
      himself in Dublin. Dirty Dublin she was fond of calling the capital of
      Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want to go to Dirty Dublin for?" she said. "You'll spend a
      lot of money, and God knows we have little enough at the present moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, I won't, Ellen," he replied. "I'll be as careful as careful can
      be; the colleen can witness to that. There's a little inn on the banks of
      the Liffey where I'll put up; it is called the 'Green Dragon,' and it's a
      cozy, snug little place, where you can have your potheen and nobody be any
      the wiser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I declare, Patrick," said his lady, facing him, "you are becoming
      downright vulgar. I wish you wouldn't talk in that way. If you have no
      respect for yourself and your ancient family, you ought to remember your
      daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I'm not doing the colleen any harm," said the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you never could, father," replied Nora, with a burst of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan surveyed her coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go upstairs and help Terence to pack his things," she said; and Nora left
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the travelers departed. As soon as they were gone Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan sent for Nora to come and sit in the room with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been thinking during the night how terribly neglected you are,"
      she said; "you are not getting the education which a girl in your position
      ought to receive. You learn nothing now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother, my education is supposed to be finished," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Finished indeed!" said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since Miss Freeman left I have had no governess; but I read a good bit
      alone. I am very fond of reading," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Distasteful as it all is to me," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, "I must take you
      in hand myself. But I do wish your Uncle George would invite you over to
      stay with them at The Laurels. It will do Terence a wonderful lot of good;
      but you want it more, you are so unkempt and undignified. You would be a
      fairly nice-looking girl if any justice was done to you; but really the
      other day, when I saw you with that terrible young person Bridget Murphy,
      it gave my heart quite a pang. You scarcely looked a lady, you were
      laughing in such a vulgar way, and quite forgetting your deportment. Now,
      what I have been thinking is that we might spend some hours together
      daily, and I would mark out a course of instruction for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mammy," answered Nora, "I should be very glad indeed to learn; you
      know I always hated having my education stopped, but father said&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to hear what your father said," interrupted Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but, mother dear, I really must think of father, and I must respect
      what he says. He told me that my grandmother stopped her schooling at
      fourteen, and he said she was the grandest lady, and the finest and
      bonniest, in the country, and that no one could ever put her to shame;
      for, although she had not much learning to boast of, she had a smart
      answer for every single thing that was said to her. He said you never
      could catch her tripping in her words, never&mdash;never; and he thinks,
      mother," continued Nora, sparkling and blushing, "that I am a little like
      my grandmother. There is her miniature upstairs. I should like to be like
      her. Father did love her so very, very much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, Nora, if those are your tastes, I have nothing further to
      say," answered Mrs. O'Shanaghgan; "but while you are under my roof and
      under my tuition, I shall insist on your doing a couple of hours' good
      reading daily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, mother; I am quite agreeable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you have quite forgotten your music?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I remember it, and I should like to play very much indeed; but the
      old piano&mdash;you must know yourself, mother dear, that it is impossible
      to get any music out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan uttered a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We seem to be beset with difficulties at every step," she said. "It is
      such a mistake your father going to Dublin now, and throwing away his
      little capital. Has he said anything to you about the mortgage, by the
      way, Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little," she answered in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I see&mdash;told it as a secret; so like the Irish, making mysteries
      about everything, and then blabbing them out the next minute. I don't
      want, my dear, to encroach upon your father's secrets, so don't be at all
      afraid. Now, bring down your Markham's History of England and Alison's
      History of Europe, and I will set you a task to prepare for me for
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora went slowly out of the room. She hated Markham's History of England.
      She had read it five or six times, and knew it by heart. She detested
      George and Richard and Mary, and their conversations with their mother
      were simply loathsome to her. Alison's History, however, was tougher
      metal, and she thought she would enjoy a good stiff reading of it. She was
      a very intelligent girl, and with advantages would have done well.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned with the books. Her mother carelessly marked about twenty
      pages in each, told her to read them in the course of the day, and to come
      to her the next morning to be questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can go now," she said. "I was very busy yesterday, and have a
      headache. I shall lie down and go to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I draw down the blind, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, please; and you can put that rug over me. Now, don't run shouting
      all over the house; try to remember you are a young lady. Really and
      truly, no one would suppose that you and Terence were brother and sister.
      He will do great credit to my brother George; he will be proud of such a
      handsome young fellow as his nephew."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora said nothing; having attended to her mother's comforts, she left the
      room. She went out into the sunshine. In her hand she carried the two
      books. Her first intention was to take them down to one end of the
      dilapidated garden and read them steadily. She was rather pleased than
      otherwise at her mother's sudden and unlooked-for solicitude with regard
      to her education. She thought it would be pleasant to learn even under her
      mother's rather peculiar method of tutelage; but, as she stood on the
      terrace looking across the exquisite summer scene, two of the dogs, Creena
      and Cushla, came into view. They rushed up to Nora with cries and barks of
      welcome. Down went the books on the gravel, and off ran the Irish girl,
      followed by the two barking dogs. A few moments later she was down on the
      shore. She had run out without her hat or parasol. What did that matter?
      The winds and sea-breezes had long ago taken their own sweet will on
      Nora's Irish complexion; they could not tan skin like hers, and had given
      up trying; they could only bring brighter roses into her cheeks and more
      sweetness into her dark-blue eyes. She forgot her troubles, as most Irish
      girls will when anything calls off their attention, and ran races with the
      dogs up and down the shore. Nora was laughing, and the dogs were barking
      and gamboling round her, when the stunted form of Hannah Croneen was seen
      approaching. Hannah wore her bedgown and her short blue serge petticoat;
      her legs and feet were bare; the breezes had caught up her short gray
      locks, and were tossing them wildly about. She looked very elfin and queer
      as she approached the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, Miss Nora, it's a word I want with you, a-colleen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;what is it, Hannah?" answered Nora. She dropped her hands to
      her sides and turned her laughing, radiant face upon the little woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then, it's a sight for sore eyes you are, Miss Nora. Why, it is a
      beauty you are, Miss Nora honey, and hondsomer and hondsomer you gets
      every time I see yez. It's the truth I'm a-telling yez, Miss Nora; it's
      the honest truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it is, Hannah, for it is very pleasant hearing," answered Nora.
      "Do I really get handsomer and handsomer? I must be a beauty like my
      grandmother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, she was a lady to worship," replied Hannah, dropping a courtesy to
      the memory; "such ways as she had, and her eyes as blue and dark as the
      blessed night when the moon's at the full, just for all the world like
      your very own. Why, you're the mortal image of her; not a doubt of it,
      miss, not a doubt of it. But there, I want to say a word to yez, and we
      need not spend time talking about nothing but mere looks. Looks is
      passing, miss; they goes by and leaves yez withered up, and there are
      other things to think of this blessed morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it's I that forgot to wish yez the top of the morning," continued the
      little woman. "I hear the masther and Masther Terry has gone to foreign
      parts&mdash;is it true, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not true of my father," replied Nora; "he has only gone to Dublin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, bless him! he's one in a thousand, is the Squire," said Hannah. "But
      what about the young masther, him with the handsome face and the ways?&mdash;aye,
      but he aint got your nice, bonny Irish ways, Miss Nora&mdash;no, that he
      aint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has gone to England for a time to visit some of my mother's
      relations," replied Nora. "I am, sure it will do him a great deal of good,
      and dear mother is so pleased. Now, then, Hannah, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannah went close to the girl and touched her on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about your promise to Andy Neil?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My promise to Andy Neil," said Nora, starting and turning pale. "How do
      you know about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little bird told me," replied Hannah. "This is what it said: 'Find out
      if Miss Nora, the bonniest and handsomest young lady in the place, has
      kept her word to Andy.' Have you done it, Miss Nora? for it's word I have
      got to take the crayther, and this very night, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?" said Nora. "Where are you going to meet him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the haunted glen, just by the Druid's Stone," replied the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At what hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tin o'clock, deary. Aw, glory be to God! it's just when the clock strikes
      tin that he'll be waiting for me there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no message," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure, Miss Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will you have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Nora, you don't mane it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do, Hannah. I have nothing to do with Andy Neil. I did what I
      could for him, but that little failed. You can tell him that if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is it in earnest you are, Miss Nora? Do you mane to say that you'll
      let the poor crayther have the roof taken off his cabin? Do you mane it
      miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't have the roof taken off his cabin," said Nora; "but father is
      away, and he is Andy's landlord, and Andy has done something to displease
      him. He had better come and talk to father himself. I kept my word, and
      spoke; but I couldn't do anything. Andy had better talk to father himself;
      I can do no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't guess as it's black rage is in the crayther's heart, and that
      there's no crime he wouldn't stoop to," whispered Hannah in a low,
      awestruck voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't help it, Hannah; I am not going to be frightened. Andy would not
      really injure me, not in cold blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, wouldn't he just? The man's heart is hot within him; it's the thought
      of the roof being taken off his cabin. I have come as his messenger. You
      had best send some sort of message to keep him on the quiet for a bit.
      Don't you send a hard message of that sort, heart asthore; you'll do a
      sight of mischief if you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can only send him a true message," replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whisht now, Miss Nora! You wouldn't come and see him yourself tonight by
      the Druid's Stone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora stood for a moment considering. She was not frightened; she had never
      known that quality. Even in the cave, when her danger was extreme, she had
      not succumbed to fear; it was impossible for her to feel it now, with the
      sunlight filling her eyes and the softest of summer breezes blowing
      against her cheeks. She looked full at Hannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't go," she said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Nora, I wouldn't ask yez if I could help myself. It's bothered I am
      entirely, and frightened too. You'll come with me, Miss Nora&mdash;won't
      yez?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not come," answered Nora. "My mother is alone, and I cannot leave
      her; but I tell you what I will do. Just to show Andy that I am not afraid
      of him, when father returns I will come. Father will be back in a couple
      of days; when he returns I will speak to him once more about Andy, and I
      will bring Andy the message; and that is all I can promise. If that is all
      you want to say to me, Hannah, I will go home now, for mother is all
      alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannah stood with her little, squat figure silhouetted against the sky;
      she had placed both her arms akimbo, and was gazing at Nora with a
      half-comical, half-frightened glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a beauty," she said, "and you has the courage of ten women. I'll
      tell Andy what you say; but, oh, glory! there's mischief in that man's
      eyes, or I'm much mistook."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't frighten me," said Nora, with a laugh. "How are the children?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, bless yez, they're as well and bonny as can be. Little Mike, he said
      he'd stand and wait till you passed by the gate, he's that took up with
      you, Miss Nora. You'd be concaited if you heard all he says about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora thrust her hand into her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," she said, "is a bright halfpenny; give it to Mike, and tell him
      that Nora loves him very much. And now I am going home. Hannah, you'll
      remember my message to Andy, and please let him understand that he is not
      going to frighten me into doing anything I don't think right."

      CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE INVITATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Squire O'Shanaghgan came home in a couple of days. He entered the house in
      noisy fashion, and appeared to be quite cheerful. He had a great deal to
      say about Dublin, and talked much of his old friends during the evening
      that followed. Nora, however, try as she would, could never meet his eye,
      and she guessed, even before he told her, that his mission had been a
      failure. It was early the next morning that he gave her this information.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tried them, one and all, colleen," he said, "and never were fellows
      more taken aback. 'Is it you to lose your property, O'Shanaghgan?' they
      said. They wouldn't believe me at first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, father, and will they help?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless you, they would if they could. There's not a better-natured man in
      the length and breadth of Ireland than Fin O'Hara; and as to John
      Fitzgerald, I believe he would take us all into his barrack of a house;
      but they can't help with money, Nora, because, bedad, they haven't got it.
      A man can't turn stones into money, even for his best and dearest
      friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what is to be done, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'll manage somehow," said Squire O'Shanaghgan; "and we have three
      months all but a week to turn round in. We'll manage by hook or by crook.
      Don't you fret your pretty little head. I wouldn't have a frown on the
      brow of my colleen for fifty O'Shanaghgans, and that's plain enough. I
      couldn't say more, could I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, father dear," answered Nora a little sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And tell me what you were doing while I was away," said the Squire.
      "Faith! I thought I could never get back fast enough, I seemed to pine so
      for you, colleen; you fit me down to the ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora began to relate the small occurrences which had taken place. The
      Squire laughed at Mrs. O'Shanaghgan's sudden desire that Nora should be an
      educated lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't hold with these new fashions about women," he said; "and you are
      educated enough for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, father, I like to read, I like to learn," said the girl. "I am very,
      very anxious to improve myself. I may be good enough for you, dear father,
      for you love me with all my faults; but some day I may pine for the
      knowledge which I have not got."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh! is it that way with you?" said the Squire, looking at her anxiously.
      "They say it's a sort of a craze now amongst women, the desire to beat us
      men on our own ground; it's very queer, and I don't understand it, and I
      am sorry if the craze has seized my girleen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! never mind, father dear; I wouldn't fret you for all the learning in
      Christendom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I wouldn't fret you for fifty estates like O'Shanaghgan," said the
      Squire, "so it strikes me we are both pretty equal in our sentiments." He
      patted her cheek, she linked her hand in his, and they walked together
      down one of the sunny meadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora thought of Neil, but determined not to trouble her father about him
      just then. Notwithstanding her cheerfulness, her own heart was very heavy.
      She possessed, with all her Irish ways, some of the common sense of her
      English ancestors, and knew from past experience that now there was no
      hope at all of saving the old acres and the old house unless something
      very unexpected turned up. She understood her father's character too well;
      he would be happy and contented until a week before the three months were
      up, and then he would break down utterly&mdash;go under, perhaps, forever.
      As to turning his back on the home of his ancestors and the acres which
      had come to him through a long line, Nora could not face such a
      possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot be; something must happen to prevent it," she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought and thought, and suddenly a daring idea came into her mind.
      All her life long her mother's relations had been brought up to her as the
      pink of propriety, the souls of wealth. Her uncle, George Hartrick, was,
      according to her mother, a wealthy man. Her mother had often described
      him. She had said that he had been very angry with her for marrying the
      Squire, but had confessed that at times he had been heard to say that the
      O'Shanaghgans were the proudest and oldest family in County Kerry, and
      that some day he would visit them on their own estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have prevented his ever coming, Nora," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan; "it
      would be such a shock to him. He thinks we live in a castle such as
      English people live in, with suites of magnificent rooms, and crowds and
      crowds of respectably dressed servants, and that we have carriages and
      horses. I have kept up this delusion; he must never come over to see the
      nakedness of the land."
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the fact that her Uncle George had never seen the nakedness of the
      land, and that he was attached to her mother, and proud of the fact that
      she had married an Irish gentleman of old descent, kept visiting Nora
      again and again. If she could only see him! If she could only beg of him
      to lend her father a little money just to avert the crowning disgrace of
      all&mdash;the O'Shanaghgans leaving their home because they could not
      afford to stop there, Nora thought, and the wild idea which had crept into
      her head gathered strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing for it; something desperate must be done," she thought.
      "Father won't save himself, because he does not know how. He will just
      drift on until a week of the fatal day, and then he will have an illness.
      I cannot let father die; I cannot let his heart be broken. I, Nora, will
      do something."
    </p>
    <p>
      So one day she locked herself in her room. She stayed there for a couple
      of hours, and when she came out again a letter was thrust into her pocket.
      Nora was not a good letter-writer, and this one had taken nearly two hours
      to produce. Tears had blotted its pages, and the paper on which it was
      written was of the poorest, but it was done at last. She put a stamp on it
      and ran downstairs. She went to Hannah's cabin. Standing in front of the
      cabin was her small admirer Mike. He was standing on his head with the
      full blaze of the sunlight all over him, his ragged trousers had slipped
      down almost to his knees, and his little brown bare legs and feet were
      twinkling in the sun. His bright sloe-black eyes were fixed on Nora as she
      approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, Mike," said the girl. Mike instantly obeyed, and gave a
      violent tug to one of his front locks by way of salutation. He then stood
      with his legs slightly apart, watching Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mike, I want you to go a message for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, miss," answered Mike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take this letter to the post-office; put it yourself into the little slit
      in the wall. I will give you a penny when you have done it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss," answered Mike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is the letter; thrust it into your pocket. Don't let anyone see it;
      it's a secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A saycret, to be sure, miss," answered Mike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you shall have your penny if you come up to the Castle tonight. Now
      good-by; run off at once and you will catch the mail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to be sure," said Mike. He winked at Nora, rolled his tongue in his
      cheek, and disappeared like a flash down the dusty road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few days seemed to drag themselves somehow. Nora felt limp, and
      not in her usual spirits. The Squire was absent a good deal, too. He was
      riding all over the country trying to get a loan from his different
      friends. He was visiting one house after another. Some of the houses were
      neat and well-to-do, but most of them sadly required funds to put them in
      order. At every house Squire O'Shanaghgan received a hearty welcome, an
      invitation to dinner, and a bed for the night; but when he made his
      request the honest face that looked into his became sorrowful, the hands
      stole to the empty pockets, and refusals, accompanied by copious
      apologies, were the invariable result.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no one in all the world I would help sooner, Pat, if I could,"
      said Squire O'Grady; "but I have not got it, my man. I am as hard pressed
      as I can be myself. We don't get in the rents these times. Times are bad&mdash;very
      bad. God help us all! But if you are turned out, what an awful thing it
      will be! And your family the oldest in the place. You're welcome, every
      one of you, to come here. As long as I have a bite and sup, you and yours
      shall share it with me." And Squire Malone said the same thing, and so did
      the other squires. There was no lack of hospitality, no lack of good will,
      no lack of sorrow for poor Squire O'Shanaghgan's calamities; but funds to
      avert the blow were not forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire more and more avoided Nora's eyes; and Nora, who now had a
      secret of her own, and a hope which she would scarcely dare to confess
      even to herself, avoided looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan was a little more fretful than usual. She forgot all
      about the lessons she had set her daughter in her laments over her absent
      son, over the tattered and disgraceful state of the Castle, and the ruin
      which seemed to engulf the family more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora, meanwhile, was counting the days. She had made herself quite <i>au
      fait</i> with postal regulations during these hours of waiting. She knew
      exactly the very time when the letter would reach Mr. Hartrick in his
      luxurious home. She thought she would give him, perhaps, twelve hours,
      perhaps twenty-four, before he replied. She knew, then, how long the
      answer would take on its way. The night before she expected her letter she
      scarcely slept at all. She came down to breakfast with black shadows under
      her eyes and her face quite wan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire, busy with his own load of trouble, scarcely noticed her. Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan took her place languidly at the head of the board. She poured
      out a cup of tea for her daughter and another for her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must send to Dublin for some better tea," she said, looking at the
      Squire. "Can you let me have a pound after breakfast, Pat? I may as well
      order a small chest while I am about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire looked at her with lack-luster eyes. Where had he got one pound
      for tea? But he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the gossoon Mike was seen passing the window with the post-bag
      hung over his shoulder. Mike was the postman in general for the
      O'Shanaghgan household for the large sum of twopence a week. He went daily
      to fetch the letters, and received his money proudly each Saturday night.
      Nora now jumped up from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The letters!" she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan surveyed her daughter critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down again, Nora," she said. "What is the matter with you? You know I
      don't allow these manners at table."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is the post, mammy," said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, if you will be patient, Margaret will bring the post in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora sat down again, trembling. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan gave her a cold stare,
      and helped herself languidly to a small snippet of leathery toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our cook gets worse and worse," she said as she broke it. "Dear, dear! I
      think I must make a change. I have heard of an excellent cook just about
      to leave some people of the name of Wilson in the town. They are English
      people, which accounts for their having a good servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the redoubtable Pegeen did thrust in her head, holding the
      post-bag at arm's length away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's the post, Miss Nora," she said; "maybe you'll fetch it, miss. I'm
      a bit dirty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora could not restrain herself another moment. She rushed across the
      room, seized the bag, and laid it by her father's side. As a rule, the
      post-bag was quickly opened, and its small contents dispersed. These
      consisted of the local paper for the Squire, which was always put up with
      the letters, a circular or two, and, at long intervals, a letter for Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan, and perhaps one from an absent friend for the Squire. No one
      was excited, as a rule, about the post at the Castle, and Nora's
      ill-suppressed anxiety was sufficiently marked now to make even her father
      look at her in some surprise. To the girl's relief, her mother
      unexpectedly came to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She thinks, perhaps, Terence will write," she said; "but I told him not
      to worry himself writing too often. Stamps cost money, and the boy will
      need every penny to keep up a decent appearance at my brother's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same, perhaps he will be an Irish boy enough to write a letter to
      his own sister," said the Squire. "So here goes; we'll look and see if
      there is anything inside here for you, my little Norrie."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire unlocked the bag and emptied the contents on the table. They
      were very meager contents; nothing but the newspaper and one letter. The
      Squire took it up and looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here we are," he said; "it is for you, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, holding out her hand. "Pass it across,
      Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is not for you, my lady, as it happens. It is for Nora. Here,
      Norrie, take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora took it up. She was shivering now, and her hand could scarcely hold
      it. It was addressed to her, beyond doubt: "Miss O'Shanaghgan, Castle
      O'Shanaghgan," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read it at once, Nora," said her mother. "I have not yet had any letter
      to speak of from Terry myself. If you read it aloud it will entertain us.
      It seems to be a thick letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think&mdash;I don't think it&mdash;it is from Terence," answered
      Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open it, Norrie, and tell us," said the Squire. "It will be refreshing to
      hear a bit of outside news."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora now opened the envelope, and took a very thick sheet of paper out.
      The contents of the letter ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Dear Nora&mdash;Your brother Terence came here a week ago, and has
      told us a great deal about you. We are enjoying having him extremely; but
      he has made us all anxious to know you also. I write now to ask if you
      will come and pay us a visit at once, while your brother is here. Ask your
      mother to spare you. You can return with Terence whenever you are tired of
      us and our ways. I have business at Holyhead next Tuesday, and could meet
      you there, if you could make it convenient to cross that day. I inclose a
      paper with the hours that the boats leave, and when they arrive at
      Holyhead. I could then take you up with me to London, and we could reach
      here that same evening. Ask my sister to spare you. You will be heartily
      welcome, my little Irish niece.&mdash;Your affectionate uncle,
    </p>
    <p>
      "George Hartrick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora could scarcely read the words aloud. When she had finished she let
      the sheet of paper flutter to the floor, and looked at her mother with
      glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may go? I must go," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Nora," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, "why that must?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mammy! oh, daddy! don't disappoint me," cried the girl. "Do&mdash;do
      let me go, please, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan again, "I never saw you so unreasonable in
      your life; you are quite carried away. Your uncle, after long years, has
      condescended to send you an invitation, and you speak in this impulsive,
      unrestrained fashion. Of course, it would be extremely nice for you to go;
      but I doubt for a single moment if it can be afforded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, daddy, daddy! please take my part!" cried Nora. "Please let me go,
      daddy&mdash;oh, daddy!" She rushed up to her father, flung her arms round
      his neck, and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan rose from the table in cold displeasure. "Give me your
      uncle's letter," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora did not glance at her; she was past speaking. So much hung on this;
      all the future of the O'Shanaghgans; the Castle, the old Castle, the home
      of her ancestors, the place in which she was born, the land she loved, the
      father she adored&mdash;all, all their future hung upon Nora's accepting
      the invitation which she had asked her uncle to give her. Oh! if they ever
      found out, what would her father and mother say? Would they ever speak to
      her again? But they must not find out, and she must go; yes, she must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Nora? Do leave her alone for a moment, wife," said the
      Squire. "There is something behind all this. I never saw Light o' the
      Morning give way to pure selfishness before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't&mdash;it isn't," sobbed Nora, her head buried on the Squire's
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My darling, light of my eyes, colleen asthore, acushla machree!" said the
      Squire. He lavished fond epithets upon the girl, and finally took her into
      his arms, and clasped her tight to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, after staring at the two in speechless indignation for
      a moment, left the room. When she reached the door she turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot stand Irish heroics," she said. "This is a disgraceful scene.
      Nora, I am thoroughly ashamed of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She carried her brother's letter away with her, however, and retired into
      the drawing room. There she read it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      How nice it would be if Nora could go! And Nora was a beauty, too&mdash;an
      Irish beauty; the sort of girl who always goes down in England. She would
      want respectable dress; and then&mdash;with her taking ways and those
      roguish, dark-blue eyes of hers, with that bewitching smile which showed a
      gleam of the whitest and most pearly teeth in the world, with the light,
      lissome figure, and the blue-black hair&mdash;what could not Irish Nora
      achieve? Conquests innumerable; she might make a match worthy of her race
      and name; she might&mdash;oh, she might do anything. She was only a child,
      it is true; but all the same she was a budding woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan sat and pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems a great pity to refuse," she said to herself. "And Nora does
      need discipline badly; the discipline of England and my brother's
      well-ordered home will work wonders with her. Poor child, her father will
      miss her. I really sometimes think the Squire is getting into his dotage.
      He makes a perfect fool of that girl; to see her there speaking in that
      selfish way, and he petting her, and calling her ridiculous names, with no
      meaning in them, and folding her in his arms as if she were a baby, and
      all for pure, downright selfishness, is enough to make any sensible person
      sick. Nora, too, who has always been spoken of as the unselfish member of
      the family, who would not spend a penny to save her life if she thought
      the Squire was going to suffer. Now she wants him to put his hand into his
      pocket for a considerable amount; for the child cannot go to my brother
      without suitable clothes&mdash;that is a foregone conclusion. But, dear
      me! all women are selfish when it comes to mere pleasure, and Nora is no
      better than the rest. For my part, I admire dear Terence's downright
      method of asking for so-and-so, and getting it. Nora is deceitful. I am
      much disappointed in her."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. &mdash; THE DIAMOND CROSS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But although Mrs. O'Shanaghgan spoke of her daughter to herself as
      deceitful, she did not at all give up the idea of her accepting her
      uncle's invitation. George Hartrick had always had an immense influence
      over his sister Ellen. He and she had been great friends long ago, when
      the handsome, bright girl had been glad to take the advice of her elder
      brother. They had almost quarreled at that brief period of madness in
      Ellen Hartrick's life, when she had fallen in love with handsome Squire
      O'Shanaghgan; but that quarrel had long been made up. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan
      had married the owner of O'Shanaghgan Castle, and had rued her brief
      madness ever since. But her pride had prevented her complaining to her
      brother George. George still imagined that she kept her passionate love
      intact for the wild Irishman. Only one thing she had managed ever since
      their parting, many years ago, and that was, that her English brother
      should not come to see her in her Irish home. One excuse after the other
      she had offered, and at last she had told him frankly that the ways of the
      Irish were not his ways; and that, when he really wanted to see his
      sister, he must invite her to come to England to visit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartrick was hurt at Ellen's behavior, and as he himself had married about
      the same time, and his own young family were growing up around him, and
      the making of money and the toil of riches were claiming him more and
      more, he did not often think of the sister who was away in the wilds of
      Ireland. She had married one of the proud old Irish chiefs. She had a very
      good position in her way; and when her son and daughter required a little
      peep into the world, Hartrick resolved that they should have it. He had
      invited Terence over; and now Nora's letter, with its perplexity, its
      anguish, its bold request, and its final tenderness, had come upon him
      with a shock of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Hartrick was a much stronger character than his sister. He was a
      very fine man, indeed, with splendid principles and downright ways; and
      there was something about this outspoken and queer letter which touched
      him in spite of himself. He was not easily touched; but he respected the
      writer of that letter. He felt that if he knew her he could get on with
      her. He resolved to treat her confidence with the respect it seemed to him
      it deserved; and, without hesitation, he wrote her the sort of letter she
      had asked him to write. She should pay him a visit, and he would find out
      for himself the true state of things at Castle O'Shanaghgan. Whether he
      would help the Squire or not, whether there was any need to help him, he
      could not say, for Nora had not really revealed much of the truth in her
      passionate letter. She had hinted at it, but she had not spoken; she would
      wait for that moment of outpouring of her heart until she arrived at The
      Laurels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, standing alone in her big, empty drawing room, and
      looking out at the summer landscape, thought of how Nora might enter her
      brother's house. Fond as Mrs. O'Shanaghgan was of Terence&mdash;he was in
      truth a son after her own heart&mdash;she had a queer kind of pride about
      her with regard to Nora. Wild and untutored as Nora looked, her mother
      knew that few girls in England could hold a candle to her, if justice were
      done her. There was something about the expression in Nora's eyes which
      even Mrs. O'Shanaghgan could scarcely resist at times, and there were
      tones and inflections of entreaty in Nora's voice which had a strange
      power of melting the hearts of those who listened to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about an hour Mrs. O'Shanaghgan went very slowly upstairs. Her
      bedroom was over the drawing room. It was just as large as the drawing
      room&mdash;a great bare apartment. The carpet which covered the floor was
      so threadbare that the boards showed through in places; the old, faded
      chintz curtains which hung at the windows were also in tatters; but they
      were perfectly clean, for Mrs. O'Shanaghgan did her best to retain that
      English cleanliness and order which she felt were so needed in the land of
      desolation, as she was pleased to call Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      A huge four-post bedstead occupied a prominent place against one of the
      walls; there was an enormous mahogany wardrobe against another; but the
      whole center of the room was bare. The dressing-table, however, which
      stood right in the center of the huge bay, was full of pretty things&mdash;silver
      appointments of different kinds, brushes and combs heavily mounted in
      silver, glass bottles with silver stoppers, perfume bottles, pretty
      knick-knacks of all sorts. When Nora was a little child she used to stand
      fascinated, gazing at her mother's dressing-table. It was the one spot
      where any of the richness of the Englishwoman's early life could still be
      found. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan went up now and looked at her dressing-table,
      sweeping her eyes rapidly over its contents. The brushes and combs, the
      bottles of scent, the button-hooks, the shoe-horns, the thousand-and-one
      little nothings, polished and bright, stood upon the dressing-table; and
      besides these there was a large, silver-mounted jewel-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan was not at all afraid to leave this jewel-case out,
      exposed to view day after day, for no one all round the place would have
      touched so much as a pin which belonged to the Squire's lady. The people
      were poor, and would think nothing of stealing half a bag of potatoes, or
      helping themselves to a good sack of fruit out of the orchard; but to take
      the things from the lady's bedroom or anything at all out of the house
      they would have scorned. They had their own honesty, and they loved the
      Squire too much to attempt anything of the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan now put a key into the lock of the jewel-case and opened
      it. When first she was married it was full of pretty things&mdash;long
      strings of pearls, a necklet of very valuable diamonds, a tiara of the
      same, rings innumerable, bracelets, head ornaments of different kinds,
      buckles for shoes, clasps for belts, pins, brooches. Mrs. O'Shanaghan,
      when Nora was a tiny child, used on every one of the little girl's
      birthdays to allow her to overhaul the jewel case; but of late years Nora
      had never looked inside it, and Mrs. O'Shanaghgan had religiously kept it
      locked. She opened it now with a sigh. The upper tray was quite empty; the
      diamonds had long ago been disposed of. They had gone to pay for Terence's
      schooling, for Terence's clothes, for one thing and another that required
      money. They had gone, oh! so quickly; had melted away so certainly. That
      first visit of her son's to England had cost Mrs. O'Shanaghgan her long
      string of pearls, which had come to her as an heirloom from her mother
      before her. They were very valuable pearls, and she had sold them for a
      tenth, a twentieth part of their value. The jeweler in Dublin, who was
      quite accustomed to receiving the poor lady's trinkets, had sent her a
      check for fifty pounds for the pearls, knowing well that he could sell
      them himself for at least three hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan now once more rifled the jewel case. There were some
      things still left&mdash;two or three rings and a diamond cross. She had
      never wanted to part with that cross. She had pictured over and over how
      it would shine on Nora's white neck; how lovely Nora would look when
      dressed for her first ball, having that white Irish cross, with its
      diamonds and its single emerald in the center, shining on her breast. But
      would it not be better to give Nora the chance of spending three or four
      months in England, the chance of educating herself, and let the cross go
      by? It was so valuable that the good lady quite thought that she ought to
      get seventy pounds for it. With seventy pounds she could fit Nora up for
      her English visit, and have a little over to keep in her own pocket. Only
      Nora must not go next Tuesday; that was quite impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan quickly determined to make the sacrifice. She could
      still supply Nora with a little, very simple pearl necklet, to wear with
      her white dress during her visit; and the cross would have to go. There
      would be a few rings still left; after that the jewel case would be empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan packed the precious cross into a little box, and took it
      out herself to register it, and to send it off to the jeweler who always
      bought the trinkets she sent him. She told him that she expected him to
      give her, without the smallest demur, seventy pounds for the cross, and
      hoped to have the money by the next day's post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having done this and dispatched her letter, she walked briskly back to the
      Castle. She saw Nora wandering about in the avenue. Nora, hatless and
      gloveless, was playing with the dogs. She seemed to have forgotten all
      about her keen disappointment of the morning. When she saw her mother
      coming up the avenue she ran to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, mammy," she said, "how early you are out! Where have you been?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dislike extremely that habit you have, Nora, of calling me mammy;
      mother is the word you should address your parent with. Please remember in
      future that I wish to be called mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, mother!" answered Nora. The girl had the sweetest temper in the
      world, and no amount of reproof ever caused her to answer angrily. "But
      where have you been?" she said, her curiosity getting the better of her
      prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again, Nora, I am sorry to say I must reprove you. I have been to the
      village on business of my own. It is scarcely your affair where I choose
      to walk in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course not, mam&mdash;I mean mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But come with me down this walk. I have something to say to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora eagerly complied. There was something in the look of her mother's
      eyes which made her guess that the usual subject of conversation&mdash;her
      own want of deportment, her ignorance of etiquette&mdash;was not to be the
      theme. She felt her heart, which had sunk like lead within her, rise again
      to the surface. Her eyes sparkled and smiles played round her rosy lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, mother," she said; "yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All impulse," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan&mdash;she laid her hand on Nora's
      arm&mdash;"all impulse, all Irish enthusiasm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot help it, you know," said Nora. "I was born that way. I am Irish,
      you know, mammy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are also English, my dear," replied her mother. "Pray remember that
      fact when you see your cousins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My cousins! My English cousins! But am I to see them? Mother, mother, do
      you mean it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do mean it, Nora. I intend you to accept your uncle's invitation. No
      heroics, please," as the girl was about to fling her arms round her
      mother's neck; "keep those for your father, Nora; I do not wish for them.
      I intend you to go and behave properly; pray remember that when you give
      way to pure Irishism, as I may express your most peculiar manners, you
      disgrace me, your mother. I mean you to go in order to have you tamed a
      little. You are absolutely untamed now, unbroken in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never want to be broken in," whispered Nora, tears of mingled
      excitement and pain at her mother's words brimming to her eyes. "Oh,
      mother!" she said, with a sudden wail, "will you never, never understand
      Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand her quite well," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, her voice assuming
      an unwonted note of softness; "and because I do understand Nora so well,"
      she added&mdash;and now she patted the girl's slender arm&mdash;"I want
      her to have this great advantage, for there is much that is good in you,
      Nora. But you are undisciplined, my dear; wild, unkempt. Little did I
      think in the old days that a daughter of mine should have to have such
      things said to her. Our more stately, more sober ways will be a revelation
      to you, Nora. To your brother Terence they will come as second nature; but
      you, my dear, will have to be warned beforehand. I warn you now that your
      Uncle George will not understand the wild excitement which you seem to
      consider the height of good breeding at O'Shanaghgan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, mother," said Nora, "don't say anything against O'Shanaghgan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I doing so?" said the poor lady. She stood for a moment and looked
      around her. Nora stopped also and when she saw her mother's eyes travel to
      the rambling old house, to the neglected lawn, the avenue overgrown with
      weeds, it seemed to her that a stab of the cruelest pain was penetrating
      her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother sees all the ugliness; she is determined to," thought Nora; "but I
      see all the beauty. Oh! the dear, dear old place, it shan't go if Nora can
      save it." Then, with a great effort, she controlled herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How am I to go?" she said. "Where is the money to come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not question me on that point," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan. "I will
      provide the means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother!" said Nora; "no, I would rather stay." But then she
      remembered all that this involved; she knew quite well that her mother had
      rifled the jewel-case; but as she had done so over and over again just for
      Terence's mere pleasure, might she not do so once more to save the old
      place?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," she said demurely; "I won't ask any questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better not, for I have not the slightest idea of replying to
      them," answered Mrs. O'Shanaghgan. "I shall write to your uncle to-day.
      You cannot go next week, however."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! why not? He said Tuesday; he would meet me at Holyhead on Tuesday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will try and provide a fit escort for you to England; But you cannot go
      next Tuesday; your wardrobe forbids it," answered Mrs. O'Shanaghgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wardrobe! Oh, mother, I really need not bother about clothes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may not bother about them, Nora; but I intend to," replied Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan. "I must buy you some suitable dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how will you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not been away from Castle O'Shanaghgan for a long time," said Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan, "and it will be a nice change for me. I shall take you to
      Dublin, and get you what things are necessary. I will then see you off on
      board the steamer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But would not father be best?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father can come with us or not, just as he pleases; but I am the
      person who will see to your wardrobe for your English visit," replied her
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora, excited, bewildered, charmed, had little or nothing to oppose to
      this plan. After all, her mother was coming out in a new light. How
      indifferent she had been about Nora's dress in the past! For Terence were
      the fashionable coats and the immaculate neckties and the nice gloves and
      the patent-leather boots. For Nora! Now and then an old dress of her
      mother's was cut down to fit the girl; but as a rule she wore anything she
      could lay hands on, made anyhow. It is true she was never grotesque like
      Biddy Murphy; but up to the present dress had scarcely entered at all as a
      factor into her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few days passed in a whirl of bewildered excitement. Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan received, as she expected, by return of post, seventy pounds
      from the Dublin jeweler for her lovely diamond cross. This man was rapidly
      making his fortune out of poor Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, and he knew that he had
      secured a splendid bargain for himself when he bought the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, therefore, with a full purse, could give directions to
      her household during her brief absence, and altogether was much brightened
      and excited at the thought of Nora's visit. She had written herself to her
      brother, saying that she would be very glad to spare her daughter, and
      giving him one or two hints with regard to Nora's manners and bringing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Irish have quite different ideas, my dear brother," she wrote, "with
      regard to etiquette to those which were instilled into us; but you will
      bear patiently with my little wild Irish girl, for she has a very true
      heart, and is also, I think you will admit, nice-looking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartrick, who read between the lines of his sister's letter, wrote to
      say that business would bring him to Holyhead on the following Tuesday
      week also, and, therefore, it would be quite convenient for him to meet
      Nora on that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening before she was to depart arrived at last. The Squire had spent
      a busy day. From the moment when Nora had told him that her mother had
      provided funds, and that she was to go to England, he had scarcely
      reverted to the matter. In truth, with that curious Irish phase in his
      character which is more or less the inheritance of every member of his
      country, he contrived to put away the disagreeable subject even from his
      thoughts. He was busy, very busy, attending to his farm and riding round
      his establishment. He was still hoping against hope that some money would
      come in his way long before the three months were up, when the mortgagee
      would foreclose on his property. He was not at all unhappy, and used to
      enter his house singing lustily or whistling loudly. Nora sometimes
      wondered if he also forgot how soon she was going to leave him. His first
      call when he entered the house had always been "Light o' the Morning,
      where are you? Come here, asthore; the old dad has returned," or some such
      expression. It came to the excited girl's heart with a pang how he would
      miss her when she was no longer there; how he would call for her in vain,
      and feel bewildered for a moment, and then remember that she was far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I shan't be long away," she thought; "and when I come back and save
      him and the old place, oh, how glad he will be! He will indeed then think
      me his Light o' the Morning, for I shall have saved him and the old home."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the last evening came, and Nora considered whether she ought to recall
      the fact that she was going away, perhaps for a couple of months, to her
      father. He came in as usual, sat down heavily on the nearest settee, and
      stretched out his long legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if I am getting old?" he said. "I declare I feel a bit tired.
      Come along here, Nora, and cheer me up. What news have you this evening,
      little woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, father! don't you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, your eyes look bright enough. What is it, girleen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going away to Dublin to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You? Bless you! so you are," said the Squire, with a hearty laugh. "Upon
      my soul I forgot all about it. Well, and you are going to have a good
      time, and you'll forget the old dad&mdash;eh?&mdash;you'll forget all
      about the old dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, father, you know better," said Nora&mdash;she flung her arms
      round his neck and laid her soft cheek against his&mdash;"as if I could
      ever forget you for a single moment," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it, a-colleen; I know it, heart's asthore. Of course you won't. I
      am right glad you are going; it will be a nice change for you. And what
      about the bits of duds&mdash;eh?&mdash;and the pretty trinkets? Why,
      you'll be going into grand society; you'll be holding your little head
      like a queen. Don't you forget, my pet, that you're Irish through and
      through, and that you come of a long line of brave ancestors. The women of
      your house never stooped to a shabby action, Nora; and never one of them
      sacrificed her honor for gold or anything else; and the men were brave,
      girleen, very brave, and had never fear in one of them. You remember that,
      and keep yourself upright and brave and proud, and come back to the old
      dad with as pure and loving a heart as you have now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, father, of course, of course. But you will miss me? you will miss
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bedad! I expect I shall," said the Squire; "but I am not going to fret,
      so don't you imagine it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you," said Nora in a low whisper&mdash;"have you done anything
      about-about the mortgage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you be aisy," said the Squire, giving her a playful poke; "and if you
      can't be aisy, be as aisy as you can," he continued, referring to the old
      well-known saying. "Things will come right enough. Why, the matter is
      weeks off yet. It was only yesterday I heard from an old friend, Larry
      M'Dermott, who has been in Australia, and has made a fine pile. He is back
      again, and I am thinking of seeing him and settling up matters with him.
      Don't you have an uneasy thought in your head, my child. I'll write to you
      when the thing is fixed up, as fixed it will be by all that's likely in a
      week or fortnight from now. But look here, Norrie, you'll want something
      to keep in your pocket when you are away. I had best give you a five-pound
      note."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said Nora. "I wouldn't touch it; I don't want it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? Is it too proud you are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; mother is helping me to this visit. I don't know how she has got
      money. I suppose in the old way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor soul!" said the Squire. "To tell you the truth, Norrie, I can't bear
      to look at that jewel-case of hers. I believe, upon my word, that it is
      nearly empty. She is very generous, is your mother. She's a very fine
      woman, and I am desperate proud of her. When M'Dermott helps me to tide
      over this pinch I'll have all those jewels back again by hook or by crook.
      Your mother shan't suffer in the long run, and I'll do a lot to the old
      place&mdash;the old house wants papering and painting. We'll dance a merry
      jig at O'Shanaghgan at your wedding, my little girl; and now don't keep
      me, for I have got to go out to meet Murphy. He said he would look around
      about this hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora left her father, and wandered out into the soft summer gloaming. She
      went down the avenue, and leaned for a time over the gate. The white gate
      was sadly in need of paint, but it was not hanging off its hinges as the
      gate was which led to the estate of Cronane. Nora put her feet on the last
      rung, leaned her arms on the top one, and swayed softly, as she thought of
      all that was about to happen, and the glorious adventures which would in
      all probability be hers during the next few weeks. As she thought, and
      forgot herself in dreams of the future, a low voice calling her name
      caused her to start. A man with shaggy hair and wild, bright eyes had come
      up to the other side of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, Miss Nora, how are ye this evening?" he said. He pulled his
      forelock as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora felt a sudden coldness come over all her rosy dreams; but she was too
      Irish and too like her ancestors to feel any fear, although she could not
      help remembering that she was nearly half a mile away from the house, and
      that there was not a soul anywhere within call.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-evening, Andy," she said. "I must be going home now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you won't just yet," he answered. He came up and laid his dirty hand
      on her white sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, don't touch me," said Nora proudly. She sprang off the gate, and
      stood a foot or two away. "Don't come in," she continued; "stay where you
      are. If you have anything to say, say it there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bedad! it's a fine young lady that it is," said the man. "It aint
      afeared, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid!" said Nora. "What do you take me for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, then, I take yez for what you are," said the man&mdash;"as fine and
      purty a slip of a girleen as ever dwelt in the old Castle; but be yez
      twice as purty, and be yez twice as fine, Andy Neil is not the man to
      forget his word, his sworn word, his oath taken to the powers above and
      the powers below, that if his bit of a roof is taken off his head, why,
      them as does it shall suffer. It's for you to know that, Miss Nora. I
      would have drowned yez in the deep pool and nobody would ever be the
      wiser, but I thought better of that; and I could here&mdash;yes, even now&mdash;I
      could choke yez round your pretty soft neck and nobody would be any the
      wiser, and I'd think no more of it than I'd think of crushing a fly. I
      won't do it; no I won't, Miss Nora; but there's <i>thim</i> as will have
      to suffer if Andy Neil is turned out of his hut. You spake for me, Miss
      Nora; you spake up for me, girleen. Why, the Squire, you're the light of
      his eyes; you spake up, and say, 'Lave poor Andy in his little hut; lave
      poor Andy with a roof over him. Don't mind the bit of a rint.' Why, then,
      Miss Nora, how can I pay the rint? Look at my arrum, dear." As the man
      spoke he thrust out his arm, pushing up his ragged shirt sleeve. The arm
      was almost like that of a skeleton's; the skin was starting over the
      bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is dreadful!" said Nora, all the pity in her heart welling up into
      her eyes. "I am truly, truly sorry for you, Andy, I would do anything in
      my power. It is just this: you know father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Squire? Yes, I guess I know Squire," said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know," continued Nora, "that when he takes what you might call the
      bit between his teeth nothing will move him. He is set against you, Andy.
      Oh, Andy! I don't believe he will listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had betther," said the man, his voice dropping to a low growl; "he had
      betther, and I say so plain. There's that in me would stick at nothing,
      and you had best know it, Miss Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you not go away, Andy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;and what for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could, but I won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe father will yield. I will send you some money from
      England if you will promise to go away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye; but I don't want it. I want to stay on. Where would my old bones lie
      when I died if I am not in my own counthry? I'm not going to leave my
      counthry for nobody. The cot where I was born shall see me die; and if the
      roof is took off, why, I'll put it back again. I'll defy him and his
      new-fangled ways and his English wife to the death. You'll see mischief if
      you don't put things right, Miss Nora. It all rests with yez, alannah."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am awfully sorry for you, Andy; but I don't believe you would seriously
      injure father, for you know what the consequences would be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye; but when a man like me is sore put to it he don't think of
      consequences. It's just the burning wish to avenge his wrongs; that's what
      he feels, and that's what I feel, Miss Nora, and so you had best take
      warning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am going away to-morrow," said the girl. "My father is in great
      trouble, and wants money very badly himself, and I am going to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be out of the way when the ruin comes. I know," said the man, with a
      loud laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; you are utterly mistaken. Andy, don't you remember when I was a
      little girl how you used to let me ride on your shoulder, and once you
      asked me for a tiny bit of my hair, that time when it was all in curls,
      and I gave you just the end of one of my curls, and you said you would
      keep it to your dying day? Would you be cruel to Nora now, and just when
      her heart is heavy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your heart heavy? You, one of the quality&mdash;'taint likely," said the
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true; my heart is very heavy. I am so anxious about father; you
      won't make me more anxious&mdash;will you? You won't do anything&mdash;anything
      wrong&mdash;while I am away? Will you make me a promise that you will let
      me go with an easy mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ask your father to give me three months' longer grace, and then we'll
      see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will speak to him," said Nora very slowly. "I am sorry, because he is
      worried about other things, and he does not take it kindly when I
      interfere in what he considers his own province; but I'll do my best. I
      cannot stay another moment now, Andy. Good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      She waved her hand to him, and ran down the avenue, looking like a white
      wraith as she disappeared into the darkness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. &mdash; A FEATHER-BED HOUSE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before she went to sleep that night Nora wrote a tiny note to her father:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAREST DAD:
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the sake of your Light o' the Morning, leave poor Andy Neil in his
      little cottage until I come back again from England. Do, dear dad; this is
      the last wish of Nora before she goes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "YOUR COLLEEN."
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought and thought, and felt that she could not have expressed
      herself better. Fear would never influence the Squire; but he would do a
      good deal for Nora. She laid the letter just where she knew he would see
      it when he entered his ramshackle study on the following day; and the next
      morning, with her arms clasped round his neck and her kisses on his
      cheeks, she gave him one hearty hug, one fervent "God bless you, dad," and
      rushed after her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outside car was ready at the door. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan was already
      mounted. Nora sprang up, and they were rattling off into the world, "to
      seek my fortune," thought the girl, "or rather the fortune of him I love
      best."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire, with his grizzled locks and his deep-set eyes, stood in the
      porch to watch Nora and her mother as they drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be back in a twinkling, father; never you fret," called out his
      daughter, and then a turn in the road hid him from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Nora, what are you crying for?" said her mother, who turned round at
      that moment, and encountered the full gaze of the large dark-blue eyes
      swimming in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing. I'll be all right in a moment," was the answer, and then the
      sunshine broke all over the girl's charming face; and before they reached
      the railway station Nora was chatting to her mother as if she had not a
      care in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first visit to Dublin and the excitement of getting really pretty
      dresses made the next two or three days pass like a flash. Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan with money in her pocket was a very different woman from Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan without a penny. She enjoyed making Nora presentable, and had
      excellent taste and a keen eye for a bargain. She fitted up her daughter
      with a modest but successful wardrobe, bought her a proper trunk to hold
      her belongings, and saw her on board the steamer for Holyhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crossing was a rough one, but the Irish girl did not suffer from
      seasickness. She stood leaning over the taffrail chatting to the captain,
      who thought her one of the most charming passengers he ever had to cross
      in the <i>Munster</i>; and when they arrived at the opposite side, Mr.
      Hartrick was waiting for his niece. He often said since that he would
      never forget his first sight of Nora O'Shanaghgan. She was wearing a gray
      tweed traveling dress, with a little gray cap to match; the slender young
      figure, the rippling black hair, and the brilliant face flashed for an
      instant on the tired vision of the man of business; then there came the
      eager outstretching of two hands, and Nora had kissed him because she
      could not help herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am so glad to see you, Uncle George!" The words, the action, the
      whole look were totally different from what his daughters would have said
      or done under similar circumstances. He felt quite sure that his sister's
      description of Nora was right in the main; but he thought her charming.
      Drawing her hand through his arm, he took her to the railway station,
      where the train was already waiting to receive its passengers. Soon they
      were flying in <i>The Wild Irish Girl</i> to Euston. Nora was provided
      with innumerable illustrated papers. Mr. Hartrick took out a little basket
      which contained sandwiches, wine, and different cakes, and fed her with
      the best he could procure. He did not ask her many questions, not even
      about the Castle or her own life. He was determined to wait for all these
      things. He read something of her story in her clear blue eyes; but he
      would not press her for her confidence. He was anxious to know her a
      little better.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is Irish, though, and they all exaggerate things so dreadfully," was
      his thought. "But I'll be very good to the child. What a contrast she is
      to Terence! Not that Terence is scarcely Irish; but anyone can see that
      this child has more of her father than her mother in her composition."
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at Euston; then there were fresh changes; a cab took them to
      Waterloo, where they once again entered the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tired, my dear niece?" said her uncle as he settled her for the final
      time in another first-class compartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. I am too excited to be tired," was her eager answer. And then
      he smiled at her, arranged the window and blind to her liking, and they
      started once more on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartrick lived in a large place near Weybridge, and Nora had her first
      glimpse of the lovely Surrey scenery. A carriage was waiting for the
      travelers when they reached their destination&mdash;a carriage drawn by a
      pair of spirited grays. Nora thought of Black Bess, and secretly compared
      the grays to the disadvantage of the latter. But she was determined to be
      as sweet and polite and English as her mother would desire. For the first
      time in her whole existence she was feeling a little shy. She would have
      been thoroughly at home on a dog cart, or on her favorite outside car, or
      on the back of Black Bess, who would have carried her swift as the wind;
      but in the landau, with her uncle seated by her side, she was altogether
      at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like riches," was her inward murmur. "I feel all in silken
      chains, and it is not a bit pleasant; but how dear mammy&mdash;oh, I must
      think of her as mother&mdash;how mother would enjoy it all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses were going slowly uphill, and now they paused at some handsome
      iron gates. These were opened by a neatly dressed woman, who courtesied to
      Mr. Hartrick, and glanced with curiosity at Nora. The carriage bowled
      rapidly down a long avenue, and drew up before a front door. A large
      mastiff rose slowly, wagged his tail, and sniffed at Nora's dress as she
      descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, my dear; come in," said her uncle. "We are too late for dinner,
      but I have ordered supper. You will want a good meal and then bed. Where
      are all the others? Where are you, Molly? Where are you, Linda? Your Irish
      cousin Nora has come."
    </p>
    <p>
      A door to the left was quickly opened, and a graceful-looking lady, in a
      beautiful dress of black silk and quantities of coffee lace, stood on the
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this Nora?" she said. "Welcome, my dear little girl." She went up to
      Nora, laid one hand on her shoulder, and kissed her gravely on the
      forehead. There was a staid, sober sort of solemnity about this kiss which
      influenced Nora and made a lump come into her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gracious English lady was very charming, and she felt at once that
      she would love her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The child is tired, Grace," said her husband to Mrs. Hartrick. "Where are
      the girls? Why are they not present?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly has been very troublesome, and I was obliged to send her to her
      room," was her reply; "but here is Terence. Terence, your sister has
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Terry!" cried Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment Terence, in full evening dress, and looking extremely
      manly and handsome, appeared upon the scene. Nora forgot everything else
      when she saw the familiar face; she ran up to her brother, flung her arms
      round his neck, and kissed him over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is a sight for sore eyes to see you!" she cried. "Oh, Terry, how
      glad, how glad I am that you are here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! hush! Nonsense, Nora. Try to remember this is an English house,"
      whispered Terence; but he kissed her affectionately. He was glad to see
      her, and he looked at her dress with marked approval. "She will soon tame
      down, and she looks very pretty," was his thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Linda was seen coming downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Nora come?" called out her sweet, high-bred voice. "How do you do,
      Nora? I am so glad to see you. If you are half as nice as Terence, you
      will be a delightful addition to our party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but I am not the least bit like Terence," said Nora. She felt rather
      hurt; she did not know why.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda was a very fair girl. She could not have been more than fifteen
      years of age, and was not so tall as Nora; but she had almost the manners
      of a woman of the world, and Nora felt unaccountably shy of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now take your cousin up to her room. Supper will be ready in a quarter of
      an hour," said Mrs. Hartrick. "Come, George; I have something to say to
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Hartrick disappeared into the drawing-room. Linda took Nora's
      hand. Nora glanced at Terence, who turned on his heel and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See you presently, sis," he called out in what he considered a very manly
      tone; and Nora felt her heart, as she expressed it, sink down into her
      boots as she followed Linda up the richly carpeted stairs. Her feet sank
      into the velvety pile, and she hated the sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all a sort of feather-bed house," she said to herself, "and I hate
      a feather-bed house. Oh, I can understand my dad better than ever
      to-night; but how mother would enjoy this!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; "THERE'S MOLLY."
    </h2>
    <p>
      As they were going upstairs Linda suddenly turned and looked full at her
      cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How very grave you are! And why have you that little frown between your
      brows? Are you vexed about anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only I thought Terry would be more glad to see me," replied Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More glad!" cried Linda. "I saw you hugging him as I ran downstairs. He
      let you. I don't know how any one could show gladness more. But come
      along; this is your room. It is next to Molly's and mine. Isn't it pretty?
      Molly and I chose it for you this morning, and we arranged those flowers.
      You will have such a lovely view, and that little peep of the Thames is so
      charming. I hope you will like your room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora entered one of the prettiest and most lovely bedrooms she had ever
      seen in her life. Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined anything so
      cozy. The perfectly chosen furniture, the elegant appointments of every
      sort and description, the view from the partly opened windows, the view of
      winding river and noble trees&mdash;all looked rich and cultivated and
      lovely; and the Irish girl, as she gazed around, found suddenly a great,
      fierce hatred rising up in her heart against what she called the mere
      prettiness. She turned and faced Linda, who was watching her with
      curiosity in her somewhat small blue eyes Linda was essentially English,
      very reserved and quiet, very self-possessed, quite a young lady of the
      world. She looked at Nora as if she meant to read her through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't you think the view perfect?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever been in Ireland?" was Nora's answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never. Oh, dear me! have you anything as pretty as this in Ireland?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Nora fiercely&mdash;"no." She left the window, turned back, and
      began to unpin her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look as if you did not care for your room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a very, very pretty room," said Nora, "and the view is very, very
      pretty, but I am tired to-night. I did not know it; but I am. I should
      like to go to bed soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you shall, of course, after you have had supper. Oh, how awfully
      thoughtless of me not to know that you must be very tried and hungry!
      Molly and I are glad you have come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where is Molly? I should like to see her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda went up to Nora and spoke in a low whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is in disgrace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In disgrace? Has she done anything naughty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, fearfully naughty. She is in hot water as usual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry," said Nora. She instantly began to feel a strong sensation of
      sympathy for Molly. She was sure, in advance, that she would like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is she in such dreadful disgrace that I may not see her?" she asked
      after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know. I don't suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then there was heard at the room door a gay laugh and a kind of
      scamper. A knock followed, but before Nora could answer the door was burst
      open, and a large, heavily made, untidy-looking girl, with a dark face and
      great big black eyes, bounded into the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have burst the bonds, and here I am," she said. "How do you do, Nora?
      I'm Molly. I am always and always in hot water. I like being in hot water.
      Now, tell-tale-tit, you can go downstairs and acquaint mother with the
      fact that I have burst the bonds, for kiss little Irish Nora I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am glad to see you," said Nora. Her depression vanished on the
      spot. She felt that, naughty as doubtless Molly was, she could get on with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, let's take a squint at you," said the eldest Miss Hartrick; "come
      over here to the light."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly took Nora by both hands over to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then, let's have a category of your charms. Terence has been telling
      us that you are very pretty. You are. Come, Linda; come and look at her.
      Did you ever see such black hair? And it's as soft as silk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly put up a rather large hand and patted Nora somewhat violently on the
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't!" said Nora, starting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear little cousin, I am a very rough specimen, and you must put up
      with me if you mean to get on at The Laurels. We are all stiff and staid
      here; we are English of the English. Everything is done by rule of thumb&mdash;breakfast
      to the minute, lunch to the minute, afternoon tea to the minute, dinner to
      the minute, even tennis to the minute. Oh! it's detestable; and I&mdash;I
      am expected to be good, and you know there's not a bit of goodness in me.
      I am all fidgets, and you can never be sure of me for two seconds at a
      time. I am a worry to mother and a worry to father; and as to Terence&mdash;oh,
      my dear creature, I am so truly thankful you are not like Terence! Here I
      drop a courtesy to his memory. What an awfully precise man he will make by
      and by! I did not know you turned out that kind of article in Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora's face, over which many emotions had been flitting, now looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that Terence is my brother?" she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly gazed at her; then she burst into a fit of hearty laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and I will get on," she said. "I like you for sticking up for your
      brother. But now, my dear, I must go back. I am supposed to stay in my
      bedroom until to-morrow morning. Linda, if you tell&mdash;well, you'll
      have to answer to me when we are going to bed, that's all. By-by, Nora.
      I'll see you in the morning. Do get her some hot water, Linda. She's worth
      waiting on; she's a very nice sort of child, and very, very pretty. If
      that is the Irish sort of face, I for one shall adore it. Good-by, Nora,
      for the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly banged herself away&mdash;her mode of exit could scarcely be called
      by any other name. As soon as the door had closed behind her Linda
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to tell, you know," she said in her precise voice; "it is very,
      very wrong of Molly to leave her bedroom when mother is punishing her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what has she done wrong?" asked Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, went against discipline. She is at school, you know, and she would
      write letters during lessons. It is really very wrong of her, and Miss
      Scott had to complain; so mother said she should stay in her room, instead
      of being downstairs to welcome you. She is a good soul enough; but we none
      of us can discipline her. She is very funny; you'll see a lot of her queer
      cranks while you are here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How old is she?" asked Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Between sixteen and seventeen; too old to be such a romp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a little older than I am," said Nora. "And how old are you, Linda?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifteen; they all tell me I look more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do; you look eighteen. You are very old for your age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you for the compliment. Now, then, do brush your hair and wash
      your hands; there's the supper-gong. Mother will be annoyed if we are not
      down in a jiffy. Now, do be quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora washed her hands, brushed her hair, and ran downstairs with her
      cousin. As she ate during the somewhat stiff meal that followed she
      thought many times of Molly. She felt that, naughty as Molly doubtless
      was, she would make the English house tolerable. Terence sat near her at
      supper, by way of extending to her brotherly attentions; but all the time
      he was talking on subjects of local interest to his aunt and uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartrick evidently thought Terence a very clever fellow, and listened
      to his remarks with a deference which Nora thought by no means good for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wants one of the dear old dad's downright snubs," was her inward
      comment. "I must have a talk with him to-morrow. If he progresses at this
      rate toward English refinement he will be unbearable at O'Shanaghgan when
      he returns; quite, quite unbearable. Oh, for a sniff of the sea! oh, for
      the wild, wild wind on my cheeks! and oh, for my dear, darling, bare
      bedroom! I shall be smothered in that heavily furnished room upstairs. Oh,
      it is all lovely, I know&mdash;very lovely; but I'm not made to enjoy it.
      I belong to the free, and I don't feel free here. The silken chains and
      the feather-bed life won't suit me; of that I am quite sure. Thank
      goodness, however, there's Molly; she is in a state of rebellion, too. I
      must not sympathize with her; but I am truly glad she is here."

      CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; BITS OF SLANG.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early the next morning Nora was awakened from a somewhat heavy sleep by
      someone pulling her violently by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wake up! wake up!" said a voice; and then Nora, who had been dreaming of
      her father, and also of Andy Neil, started up, crying as she did so, "Oh,
      don't, Andy! I know father will let you stay a little longer in the cot.
      Don't, don't, Andy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, in the name of fortune, is Andy?" called the clear voice of Molly
      Hartrick. "Do wake up, Nora, and don't look so dazed. You really are a
      most exciting person to have staying in the house. Who is Andy, and what
      cot are you going to turn him out of? Is he a baby?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora now began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I quite forgot that I was in England," she said. "Am I really in England?
      Are you&mdash;are you&mdash;&mdash;Oh, now I remember everything. You are
      Molly Hartrick. What is the hour? Is it late? Have I missed breakfast?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless you, child! lie down and keep quiet; it's not more than six
      o'clock. I wanted to see some more of you all by myself. I am out of
      punishment now; it ended at midnight, and I am as free as anybody else;
      but as it is extremely likely I shall be back in punishment by the
      evening, I thought we would have a little chat while I was able to have
      it. Just make way for me in your bed; I'll nestle up close to you, and
      we'll be ever so jolly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do," said Nora, in a hearty tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly scrambled in, taking the lion's share of the bed, Nora lay on the
      edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad you are facing the light, for I can examine your features
      well," said Molly. "You certainly are very nice-looking. How prettily your
      eyebrows are arched, and what white teeth you have! And, although you have
      that wonderful black hair, you have a fair skin, and your cheeks have just
      enough color; not too much. I hate florid people; but you are just
      perfect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you would not flatter me, Molly," said Nora; "nobody flatters me
      in Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't? But I thought they were a perfect nation of flatterers. I am
      sure it is always said of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, if you mean the poor people," said Nora; "they make pretty speeches,
      but nobody thinks anything about that. Everybody makes pretty speeches to
      everybody else, except when we are having a violent scold by way of a
      change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How delicious!" said Molly. "And what sort of house have you? Like this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not the least like this," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With what emphasis you speak. Do you know that father told me you lived
      in a beautiful place, a castle hanging over the sea, and that your
      mountains and your sea and your old castle were things to be proud of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he? Did your father really say that?" asked Nora. She sat up on her
      elbow; her eyes were shining; they assumed a look which Nora's eyes often
      wore when she was, as she expressed it, "seeing things out of her head."
      Far-off castles in the clouds would Nora look at then; rainbow-tinted were
      they, and their summits reached heaven. Molly gazed at her with deepening
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Nora," she said; "he did say it. He told me so before Terence came;
      but I&mdash;do forgive me&mdash;I don't care for Terence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not talk against him to me," said Nora, "because he happens to
      be my brother; but I'll just whisper one thing back to you, Molly&mdash;if
      he was not my brother he would not suit me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How nice of you to say that! We shall get on splendidly. Of course, you
      must stick up for him, being your brother; he stuck up for you before you
      came. It is very nice and loyal of you, and I quite understand. But, dear
      me! I am not likely to see much of you while you are here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? Are you not going to stay here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear, yes; I'll stay. School has just begun over again, you know,
      and I am always in hot water. I cannot help it; it is a sort of way of
      mine. This is the kind of way I live. Breakfast every morning; then a
      lecture from mother or from father. Off I go in low spirits, with a great,
      sore heart inside me; then comes the hateful discipline of school; and
      every day I get into disgrace. I have a lot of lessons returned, and am
      low down in my class, instead of high up, and am treated from first to
      last as a naughty child. By the middle of the day I am a very naughty
      child indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are not a child at all, Molly; you are a woman. Why, you are
      older than I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what have years to do with it?" interrupted Molly. "I shall be a
      child all my days, I tell you. I shall never be really old. I like
      mischief and insubordination, and&mdash;and&mdash;let me whisper it to
      you, little Nora&mdash;vulgarity. Yes, I do love to be vulgar. I like
      shocking mother; I like shocking father. Since Terence came I have had
      rare fun shocking him. I have learned a lot of slang, and whenever I see
      Terence I shout it at him. He has got quite nervous lately, and avoids me.
      He likes Linda awfully, but he avoids me. But, to go on with my day. I am
      back from school to early dinner, generally in disgrace. I am not allowed
      to speak at dinner. Back again I go to school, and I am home, or supposed
      to be home, at half-past four; but not a bit of it, my dear; I don't get
      home till about six, because I am kept in to learn my lessons. It is
      disgraceful, of course; but it is a fact. Then back I come, and mother has
      a talk with me. However busy mother may be, and she is a very busy woman,
      Nora&mdash;you will soon find that out&mdash;she always has time to find
      out if I have done anything naughty; and, as fibs are not any of my
      accomplishments, I always tell her the truth; and then what do you think
      happens? An evening quite to myself in my bedroom; my dinner sent up to me
      there, and I eating it in solitary state. They are all accustomed to it.
      They open their eyes and almost glare at me when by a mere chance I do
      come down to dinner. They are quite uncomfortable, because, you see, I am
      waiting my opportunity to fire slang at one of them. I always do, and
      always will. I never could fit into the dull life of the English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be Irish, really," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say so! But I am afraid I am not. I would give all the world to
      be, but am quite certain I am not. There, now, of course I'd be awfully
      scolded if it was found out that I had awakened you at this hour, and had
      confided my little history to you. I am over sixteen. I shall be seventeen
      in ten months' time. And that is my history, insubordination from first to
      last. I don't suppose anybody really likes me, unless it is poor Annie
      Jefferson at school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is Annie Jefferson, Molly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very shabby sort of girl, who is always in hot water too. I have taken
      to her, and she just adores me. There is no one else who loves me; and
      she, poor child, would not be admitted inside these walls; she is not
      aristocratic enough. Dear me, Nora! it is wrong of me to give you all this
      information so soon; and don't look anxious about me, little goose, for I
      have taken an enormous fancy to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you one thing," said Nora after a pause, "if you will never
      tell again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a secret!" said Molly. "Tell it out, Nora. I love secrets. I'll never
      betray; I have no friends to betray them to. You may tell me with all the
      heart in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is this," said Nora; "we are not at all rich at home. We are
      poor, and have no luxuries and the dear old house is very bare; and, oh!
      but, Molly, there is no place like it&mdash;no place like it. It's worth
      all the world to me; and when I came here last night, and saw your great,
      rich, beautiful house, I&mdash;I quite hated it, and I almost hated Linda
      too; and even my uncle, who has been so kind, I could not get up one
      charitable thought for him, nor for your mother, who is such a beautiful,
      gracious lady; and even Terence&mdash;oh! Terry seemed quite English. Oh,
      I was miserable! But when I saw you, Molly, I said to myself, 'There is
      one person who will fit me'; and&mdash;oh, don't Molly! What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only, if you say another word I shall squeeze you to death in the hug I
      am giving you," said Molly. Her arms were flung tightly round Nora's neck.
      She kissed her passionately three or four times.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll be friends. I'll stick up for you through thick and thin," said
      Molly. "And now I'm off; for if Linda caught me woe betide me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word before you go, Molly," called out Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Molly, standing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try to keep straight to-day, for my sake, for I shall want to say a great
      deal to you to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, so I will," answered Molly. "Now then, off I go."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was banged behind her. It awoke Mrs. Hartrick, who turned slowly
      on her pillow, and said to herself, "I am quite certain that wicked girl
      Molly has been disturbing our poor little traveler." But she fell asleep,
      and Nora lay thinking of Molly. How queer she was! And yet&mdash;and yet
      she was the only person in the English home who had yet managed to touch
      Nora's warm Irish heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the day passed somewhat soberly. Molly and Linda both started
      for school immediately after an early breakfast. Terence went to town with
      his uncle, and Nora and her aunt were left alone. She had earnestly hoped
      that she might have had one of her first important talks with Mr. Hartrick
      before he left that morning; but he evidently had no idea of giving her an
      opportunity. He spoke to her kindly, but seemed to regard her already as
      quite one of the family, and certainly was not disposed to alter his plans
      or put out his business arrangements on her account. She resolved, with a
      slightly impatient sigh, to abide her time, and followed her aunt into the
      morning-room, where the good lady produced some fancywork, and asked Nora
      if she would like to help her to arrange little squares for a large
      patchwork quilt which was to be raffled for at a bazar shortly to be held
      in the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora gravely took the little bits of colored silk, and, under her aunt's
      supervision, began to arrange them in patterns. She was not a neat worker,
      and the task was by no means to her taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What time ought I to write in order to catch the post?" she said,
      breaking the stillness, and raising her lovely eyes to Mrs. Hartrick's
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The post goes out many times in the day, Nora; but if you want to catch
      the Irish mail, you must have your letter in the box in the hall by
      half-past three. There is plenty of time, my dear, and you will find
      notepaper and everything you require in the escritoire in the study. You
      can always go there if you wish to write your letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you are tired of work, you can go out and walk about the grounds. I
      will take you for a drive this afternoon. I am sorry that you have arrived
      just when the girls have gone back to school; but you and Linda can have a
      good deal of fun in the evenings, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why not Molly too?" asked Nora. She felt rather alarmed at mentioning
      her elder cousin's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick did not speak at all for a moment; then she gave a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to have to tell you, Nora, that Molly is by no means a good
      girl. She is extremely rebellious and troublesome; and if this state of
      things goes on much longer her father and I will be obliged to send her to
      a very strict school as a boarder. We do not wish to do that, as my
      husband does not approve of boarding-schools for girls. At present she is
      spending a good deal of her time in punishment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope she won't be in punishment to-night," said Nora. "I like her so
      much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you, my dear? I hope she won't influence you to become insubordinate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora felt restless, and some of the bits of colored silk fluttered to the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be careful, my dear Nora," said her aunt in a somewhat sharp voice;
      "don't let those bits of silk get about on the carpet. I am most
      particular that everything in the house should be kept neat and in order.
      I will get you a little work-basket to keep your things in when next I go
      upstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Aunt Grace," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, as we are alone," continued the good lady, "you might tell me
      something of your life. Your uncle is very anxious that your mother should
      come and pay us a visit. He is very much attached to his sister, and it
      seems to me strange that they should not have met for so many years. You
      have a beautiful place at home, Nora&mdash;have you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Nora; "the place is"&mdash;she paused, and her voice took an
      added emphasis&mdash;"beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How emphatically you say it, dear! You have a pretty mode of speech,
      although very, very Irish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am Irish, you see, Aunt Grace," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear, you need scarcely tell me that; your brogue betrays you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But mother was always particular that I should speak correctly,"
      continued the girl. "Does my accent offend you, Aunt Grace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dear; your uncle and I both think it quite charming. But tell me some
      more. Of course you are very busy just now with your studies, Nora. A girl
      of your age&mdash;how old did you say you were&mdash;sixteen?&mdash;a girl
      of your age has not a moment to lose in acquiring those things which are
      essential to the education of an accomplished woman of the present day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid I shall shock you very much indeed, Aunt Grace, when I tell
      you that my education is supposed to be finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Finished!" said Mrs. Hartrick. She paused for a moment and stared full at
      Nora. "I was astonished," she continued, "when your uncle suggested that
      you should pay us a visit now. I said, as September had begun, you would
      be going back to school; but you accepted the invitation, or rather your
      mother did for you, without any allusion to your school. You must have got
      on very well, Nora, to be finished by now. How many languages do you
      know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can chatter in Irish after a fashion," said Nora; "and I am supposed,
      after a fashion also, to know my own tongue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Irish!" said Mrs. Hartrick in a tone of quivering scorn. "I don't mean
      anything of that sort. I allude to your acquaintance with French, German,
      and Italian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do know a very little French," said Nora; "that is, I can read one or
      two books in French. Mother taught me what I know; but I do not know any
      German or any Italian. I don't see that it matters," she continued, a
      flush coming into her cheeks. "I should never talk German or Italian in
      Ireland. I wouldn't be understood if I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That has nothing to do with it, Nora; and your tone, my dear, without
      meaning it, of course, was just a shade pert just now. It is essential in
      the present day that all well-educated women should be able to speak at
      least in three languages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I am sorry, Aunt Grace, for I am afraid you will despise me. I shall
      never be well educated in that sense of the word."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will speak to your uncle," she said after a pause. "While you are here
      you can have lessons. It would be possible to arrange that you went to
      school with Linda and Molly, and had French and German lessons while
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't expect to be very long in England," said Nora, a note of
      alarm in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear child, now that we have got you, we shall not allow you to go
      in a hurry. It is such a nice change for you, too; this is your first
      visit to England, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Aunt Grace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't let you go for some time, little Nora. Your brother is a dear
      fellow; your uncle and I admire him immensely, and he is quite well
      educated and so adaptable; and I am sure you would be the same, my dear,
      when you have had the many chances which will be offered to you here. You
      must look upon me as your real aunt, dear, and tell me anything that you
      wish. Don't be shy of me, my love; I can quite understand that a young
      girl, when she first leaves her mother, is rather shy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never felt shy at home," answered Nora; "but then, you know, I was more
      with father than with mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More with your father! Does he stay at home all day, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is always about the place; he has nothing else to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course he has large estates."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are not so very large, Aunt Grace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, dear, that is a relative term, of course; but from your uncle's
      description, and to judge from your mother's letters, it must be a very
      large place. By the way, how does she manage her servants? She must have a
      large staff at Castle O'Shanaghgan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think we manage our servants particularly well," said Nora. "It
      is true they all stay with us; but then we don't keep many."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Pegeen&mdash;she is the parlor-maid&mdash;and there's the cook&mdash;we
      do change our cook sometimes, for mother is rather particular; then there
      is the woman who attends to the fowls, and the woman who does the washing,
      and&mdash;I think that is about all. Oh, there's the post-boy; perhaps you
      would consider him a servant, but I scarcely think he ought to be called
      one. We give him twopence a week for fetching the letters. He is a very
      good little boy. He stands on his head whenever he sees me; he is very
      fond of me, and that is the way he shows his affection. It would make you
      laugh, Aunt Grace, if you saw Michael standing on his head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would make me shudder, you mean," said Mrs. Hartrick. "Really, Nora,
      your account of your mother's home is rather disparaging; two or three
      very rough servants, and no more. But I understood you lived in castle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a castle may mean anything; but it is not fair for you and Uncle
      George to think we are rich, for we are very poor. And," continued Nora,
      "for my part, I love to be poor." She stood up abruptly. In her excitement
      all her bits of silk tumbled to the floor. "May I go out and have a run,
      Aunt Grace?" she said. "I feel quite stiff. I am not accustomed to being
      indoors for so long at a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can go out, Nora, if you like," said her aunt in a displeased tone;
      "but, first, have the goodness to pick up all those bits you have
      dropped."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora, with flushed cheeks, stooped and picked up the bits of silk. She
      wrapped them in a piece of paper and put them on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can stay out for an hour, my dear; but you are surely not going
      without a hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never wear a hat at home," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must run upstairs and fetch your hat," said Mrs. Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Nora never felt more tried in the whole course of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall get as bad as Molly if this goes on," she thought to herself.

      CHAPTER XV. &mdash; TWO LETTERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "DEAR MOTHER [wrote Nora O'Shanaghgan later on that same morning]: I
      arrived safely yesterday. Uncle George met me at Holyhead, and was very
      kind indeed. I had a comfortable journey up to town, and Uncle George saw
      that I wanted for nothing. When we got to London we drove across the town
      to another station, called Waterloo, and took a train on here. A carriage
      met us at the station with a pair of beautiful gray horses. They were not
      as handsome as Black Bess, but they were very beautiful; and we arrived
      here between eight and nine o'clock. This is just the sort of place you
      would like, mother; such thick carpets on the stairs, and such large,
      spacious, splendidly furnished rooms; and Aunt Grace has meals to the
      minute; and they have lots and lots of servants; and my bedroom&mdash;oh,
      mother! I think you would revel in my bedroom. It has such a terribly
      thick carpet on the floor&mdash;I mean it has a thick carpet on the floor;
      and there is a view from the window, the sort you have so often described
      to me&mdash;great big trees, and a lawn like velvet, and four or five
      tennis-courts, and a shrubbery with all the trees cut so exact and round
      and proper, and a peep of the River Thames just beyond. My cousins keep a
      boat on the river, and they often go out in the summer evenings. They are
      going to take me for a row on Saturday, when the girls have a holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw Terence almost immediately after I arrived. He looked just as you
      would like to see him, so handsome in his evening dress. He was a little
      stiff&mdash;at least, I mean he was very correct in his manner. We had
      supper when we arrived. I was awfully hungry, but I did not like to eat
      too much, for Terence seemed so correct&mdash;nice in his manner, I mean&mdash;and
      everything was just as you have described things when you were young.
      There are two girls, my cousins&mdash;Linda, a very pretty girl, fair, and
      so very neatly dressed; and Molly, who is not the least like the others.
      You would not like Molly; she is rather rough; but of course I must not
      complain of her. I have been sitting with Aunt Grace all the morning,
      until I could bear it no longer&mdash;I mean, until I got a little stiff
      in my legs, and then I had a run in the garden. Now I am writing this
      letter in Aunt Grace's morning-room, and if I look round I shall see her
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by, dear mother. I will write again in a day or two.&mdash;Your
      affectionate daughter,
    </p>
    <p>
      "NORA O'SHANAGHGAN."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," said Nora, under her breath, "that's done. Now for daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took out another sheet of paper, and began to scribble rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, darling, love of my heart! Daddy, daddy, oh! but it's I that
      miss you. I am writing to you here in this could, could country. Oh,
      daddy, if I could run to you now, wouldn't I? What are you doing without
      your Light o' the Morning? I am pent up, daddy, and I don't think I can
      stand it much longer. It's but a tiny visit I'll pay, and then I'll come
      back again to the mountains and the sea, and the old, old house, and the
      dear, darling dad. Keep up your heart, daddy; you'll soon have Light o'
      the Morning home. Oh! it's so proper, and I'm wrapped up in silk chains;
      they are surrounding me everywhere, and I can't quite bear it. Aunt Grace
      is sitting here; I am writing in her morning-room. Oh! if I could,
      wouldn't I scream, or shout, or do something awfully wicked; but I must
      not, for it is the English way. They have got the wild bird Nora into the
      English cage; and, darling dad asthore, it's her heart that will be broke
      if she stays here long. There's one comfort I have&mdash;or, bedad! I
      don't think I could bear it&mdash;and that's Molly. She's a bit of a romp
      and a bit of a scamp, and she has a daring spirit of her own, and she
      hates the conventionalities, and she would like to be Irish too. She
      can't, poor colleen; but she is nice and worth knowing, and she'll just
      keep my heart from being broke entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are they all at home? Give them lashins and lavins of love from Nora.
      Tell them it's soon I'll be back with them. You go round and give a
      message to each and all; and don't forget Hannah Croneen, and little Mike,
      and Bridget Murphy, and Squire Murphy, and the rest&mdash;all and every
      one who remembers Nora O'Shanaghgan. Tell them it's her heart is
      imprisoned till she gets back to them; and she would rather have one bit
      of her own native soil than all the gold in the whole of England. I
      declare it's rough and wild I am getting, and my heart is bleeding. I have
      written a correct letter to mother, and given her the news; but I am
      telling you a bit of my true, true heart. Send for me if you miss me too
      much, and I'll fly back to you. Oh! it's chains wouldn't keep me, for go I
      must if this state of things continues much longer.&mdash;Your
    </p>
    <p>
      "LIGHT O' THE MORNING."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two letters were written, the last one relieving Nora's feelings not a
      little. She put them into separate envelopes and stamped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick rose, went over to her desk, and saw Nora's letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you have written to your parents," she said. "Quite right, my dear.
      But why put them into separate envelopes? They could go nicely in one.
      That, really, is willful waste, Nora, which we in England never permit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please, don't change them, Aunt Grace," said Nora, as Mrs. Hartrick
      took the two letters up and paused before opening one of the envelopes.
      "Please, please, let them go as they are. It's my own stamp," she
      continued, losing all sense of grammar in her excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, just as you please. There, don't excite yourself, Nora. I
      only suggested that, when one stamp would do, it was rather wasteful to
      spend two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, daddy does like to get his own letters to his own self," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father, you mean. You don't, surely, call him by the vulgar word
      daddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bedad! but I do," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick turned and gave her niece a frozen glance. Presently she
      laid her hand on the girl's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to complain or to lecture you," she said; "but that
      expression must not pass your lips again while you are here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shan't. I am ever so sorry," said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are, dear; and how flushed your cheeks are! You seem quite
      tired. Now, go upstairs and wash your hands; the luncheon-gong will ring
      in five minutes, and we must be punctual at meals."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora slowly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! but it's like lead my heart is," she said to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed very dismally for the wild Irish girl. After lunch she and
      her aunt had a long and proper drive. They drove through lovely country;
      but Nora was feeling even a little bit cross, and could not see the
      beauties of the perfectly tilled landscape, of the orderly fields, of the
      lovely hedgerows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too tidy," she said once in a choking sort of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tidy!" answered Mrs. Hartrick. She looked at Nora, tittered a sigh, and
      did not speak of the beauties of the country again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got back from their drive things were a little better, for Linda
      and Molly had returned from school; and, for a wonder, Molly was not in
      disgrace. She looked quite excited, and darting out of the house, took
      Nora's hand and pulled it inside her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and have a talk," she said. "I am hungering for a chat with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tea will be ready in fifteen minutes, Molly," called out Mrs. Hartrick,
      then entered the house accompanied by Linda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Molly and Nora went round to the shrubbery at the back of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter with you?" said Molly. She turned and faced her
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora's eyes filled with sudden tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is only that I am keeping in so much," she said; "and&mdash;and, oh! I
      do wish you were not all quite so tidy. I am just mad for somebody to be
      wild and unkempt. I feel that I could take down my hair, or tear a rent in
      my dress&mdash;anything rather than the neatness. Oh! I hate your
      landscapes, and your trim hedges, and your trim house, and your&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on," said Molly; "let it out; let it out. I'll never repeat it. You
      must come in, in about a quarter of an hour, to a stiff meal. You will
      have to sit upright, let me tell you, and not lounge; and you will have to
      eat your bread and butter very nicely, and sip your tea, and not eat
      overmuch. Mother does not approve of it. Then when tea is over you will
      have to leave the room and go upstairs and get things out for dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My things out for dinner?" gasped Nora. "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your evening-dress. Do you suppose you will be allowed to dine in your
      morning-dress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, to be sure," said Nora, brightening; "now I understand. Mother did
      get me a white frock, and she had it cut square in the neck, and the
      sleeves are a little short."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will look sweet in that," said Molly, gazing at her critically; "and
      I will bring you in a bunch of sweet-peas to put in your belt, and you can
      have a little bunch in your hair, too, if you like. You know you are
      awfully pretty. I am sure Linda is just mad with jealousy about it; I can
      see it, although she does not say anything. She is rather disparaging
      about you, is Linda; that is one of her dear little ways. She runs people
      down with faint praise. She was talking a lot about you as we were going
      to school this morning. She began: 'You know, I do think Nora is a pretty
      girl; but it is such a pity that&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't," said Nora, suddenly putting out her hand and closing Molly's
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What in the world are you doing that for?" said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I don't want to hear; she did not mean me to know that she said
      these things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a curiosity you are!" said Molly. "So wild, so defiant, and yet&mdash;oh,
      of course, I like you awfully. Do you know that the vision of your face
      kept me good all day? Isn't that something to be proud of? I didn't answer
      one of my teachers back, and I did have a scolding, let me tell you. Oh,
      my music; you don't know what I suffer over it. I have not a single
      particle of taste. I have not the faintest ghost of an ear; but mother
      insists on my learning. I could draw; I could sketch; I can do anything
      with my pencil; but that does not suit mother. It must be music. I must
      play; I must play well at sight; I must play all sorts of difficult
      accompaniments for songs, because gentlemen like to have their songs
      accompanied for them; and I must be able to do this the very moment the
      music is put before me. And I must not play too loud; I must play just
      right, in perfect time; and I must be ready, when there is nothing else
      being done, to play long pieces, those smart kind of things people do play
      in the present day; and I must never play a wrong note. Oh, dear! oh,
      dear! and I simply cannot do these things. I don't know wrong notes from
      right. I really don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Molly!" cried Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are; I can see that you are musical."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I am, very. I mean I think I should always know a wrong note from
      a right one; but I have not had many opportunities of learning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, good gracious me! what next?" exclaimed Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand what you mean," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I am relieving my feelings, just as you relieved yours a short
      time ago. Oh, dear! my music. I know I played atrociously; but that
      dreadful Mrs. Elford was so cross; she did thump so herself on the piano,
      and told me that my fingers were like sticks. And what could I do? I
      longed to let out some of my expressions at her. You must know that I am
      feared on account of my expressions&mdash;my slang, I call them. They do
      shock people so, and it is simply irresistible to see them shudder, and
      close their eyes, and draw themselves together, and then majestically walk
      out of the room. The headmistress is summoned then, and I&mdash;I am
      doomed. I get my pieces to do out of school; and when I come home mother
      lectures me, and sends me to my bedroom. But I am free to-night. I have
      been good all day; and it is on account of you, Nora; just because you are
      a little Irish witch; and I sympathize with you to the bottom of my soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly! Molly!" here called out Linda's voice; "mother says it's time for
      you and Nora to come in to wash your hands for tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, go to Jericho!" called out Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda turned immediately and went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a tell-tale-tit," said Molly. "She will be sure to repeat that to
      mother; and do you think I shall be allowed any cake? There is a very nice
      kind of rice-cake which cook makes, and I am particularly fond of it.
      You'll see I am not to have any, just because I said 'Go to Jericho!' I am
      sure I wish Linda would go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But those kind of things are rather vulgar, aren't they?" said Nora.
      "Father wouldn't like them. We say all kinds of funny things at home, but
      not things like that. I wish you would not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish I would not what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Use words like 'Go to Jericho!' Father would not like to hear you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a very audacious kind of girl, let me tell you, Nora," said
      Molly. She colored, and looked annoyed for a moment, then burst into a
      laugh. "But I like you all the better for not being afraid of me," she
      continued. "Come, let's go into the house; we can relieve our feelings
      somehow to-night; we'll have a lark somehow; you mark my words. In the
      meantime mum's the word."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; A CHEEKY IRISH GIRL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At tea the girls were very stiff. Molly and Nora were put as far as
      possible asunder. They did not have tea in the drawing room, but in the
      dining room, and Mrs. Hartrick presided. There was jam on the table, and
      two or three kinds of cake, and, of course, plenty of bread and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Molly had predicted, however, the news of her expression "Go to
      Jericho!" had already reached Mrs. Hartrick's ears, and the fiat had gone
      forth that she was only to eat bread and butter. It was handed to her, in
      a marked way, by her mother, and Linda's light-blue eyes flashed with
      pleasure. Nora felt at that moment that she almost hated Linda. She
      herself ate resignedly, and without much appetite. Her spirits were down
      to zero. It seemed far less likely than it did before she left
      O'Shanaghgan that she could help her father out of his scrape. It was
      almost impossible to break through these chains of propriety, of neatness,
      of order. Would anybody in this trim household care in the very least
      whether the old Irishman broke his heart or not? whether he and the Irish
      girl had to go forth from the home of their ancestors? whether the wild,
      beautiful, rack-rent sort of place was kept in the family or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      "They none of them care," thought Nora. "I don't believe Uncle George will
      do anything; but all the same I have got to ask him. He was nice about my
      letter, I will own that; but will he really, really help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A penny for your thoughts, Nora, my dear," said Mrs. Hartrick at this
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora glanced up with a guilty flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I was only thinking," she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear, what about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About father." Nora colored as she spoke, and Linda fixed her eyes on her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very pretty indeed of you, my dear, to think so much of your father,"
      said Mrs. Hartrick; "but I cannot help giving you a hint. It is not
      considered good manners for a girl to be absent-minded while she is in
      public. You are more or less in public now; I am here, and your cousins,
      and it is our bounden duty each to try and make the others pleasant, to
      add to the enjoyment of the meal by a little graceful conversation.
      Absent-mindedness is very dull for others, my dear Nora; so in future try
      not to look quite so abstracted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora colored again. Molly, at the other end of the table, bit her lip
      furiously, and stretched out her hand to help herself to another thick
      piece of bread and butter. In doing so she upset a small milk-jug; a
      stream of milk flowed down the tablecloth, and Mrs. Hartrick rose in
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the fourth evening running you have spilt something on the
      tablecloth, Molly. Go to your room immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly rose, dropped a mocking courtesy to her mother, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Linda dear, run after your sister, and tell her that, for her
      impertinence to me, she is to remain in her room until dinner-time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! please forgive her this time; she didn't mean it really," burst from
      Nora's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora!" said Mrs. Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I am sorry for her; please forgive her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora!" repeated her aunt again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is because you do not understand her that she goes on like that; she
      is such a fine girl, twice&mdash;twice as fine as Linda. Oh, I do wish you
      would forgive her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Linda in a mocking voice. She had got as far as the
      door, and had overheard Nora's words. She now glanced at her mother, as
      much as to say, "I told you so," and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora had jumped to her feet. She had forgotten prudence; she had forgotten
      politeness; her eyes were bright with suppressed fire, and her glib Irish
      tongue was eager to enter into the fray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must speak out," she said. "Molly is more like me than anybody else in
      this house, and I must take her part. She would be a very, very good girl
      if she were understood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are your ideas with regard to understanding Molly?" said Mrs.
      Hartrick in that very calm and icy voice which irritated poor Nora almost
      past endurance. She was speechless for a moment, struggling with fresh
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I wish&mdash;&mdash;" she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I wish, my dear Nora, that you would remember the politeness due to
      your hostess. I also wish that you would consider how very silly you are
      when you speak as you are now doing. I do not know what your Irish habits
      are; but if it is considered in Ireland rather a virtue than otherwise to
      spill a milk jug, and allow the contents to deface the tablecloth, I am
      sorry for you, that is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot understand. I&mdash;I am sorry I came," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      She burst into sudden tears, and ran out of the room. In a few moments
      Linda came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly is storming," she said; "she is in an awful rage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Linda, and don't tell tales of your sister," answered Mrs.
      Hartrick in an annoyed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, mother!" said Linda; "and where is Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora is a very impertinent little girl. She is wild, however, and
      unbroken. We must all have patience with her. Poor child! it is terrible
      to think that she is your father's niece. What a contrast to dear Terence!
      He is a very nice, polite boy. I am sorry for Nora. Of course, as to
      Molly, she is quite different. She has always had the advantage of my
      bringing-up; whereas poor Nora&mdash;well, I must say I am surprised at my
      sister-in-law. I did not think your father's sister would have been so
      remiss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is one thing I ought to say," said Linda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that, dear? Linda, do sit up straight, and don't poke your head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda drew herself up, and looked prettily toward her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you wish to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is this. I think Nora will be a very bad companion for Molly. Molly
      will be worse than ever that Nora is in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear Linda, it is your duty to be a good deal with your cousin.
      You are too fond of poking holes in others; you are a little hard upon
      your sister Molly. I do not wish to excuse Molly; but it is not your place
      as her younger sister to, as it were, rejoice in her many faults."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't, mother," said Linda, coloring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Linda dear, I am afraid you do. You must try and break yourself of that
      very unchristian habit. But, on the whole, my dear, I am pleased with you.
      You are careful to do what I wish; you learn your lessons correctly; I
      have good reports of you from your schoolmistresses; and if you are
      careful, my dear, you will correct those little habits which mar the
      perfect whole."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear mother," said Linda. "I will try to do what you wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I particularly want you to do just now is to be gentle and patient
      with your cousin; you must remember that she has never had your
      advantages. Be with her a good deal; talk to her as nicely as you can;
      hint to her what I wish. Of course, if she becomes quite incorrigible, it
      will be impossible for me to have her long with you and Molly; but the
      child is much to be pitied; she is a very pretty creature, and with a
      little care could be made most presentable. I by no means give her up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear mother, how sweetly Christian-like and forgiving you are!" said
      Linda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hush, my dear; hush! I only do my duty; I hope I shall never fail in
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick rose from the tea-table, and Linda soon afterward followed
      her. Mr. Hartrick was seen coming down the avenue. He generally walked
      from the station. He came in now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a hot day it is!" he said. "Pour me out a cup of tea, Linda. I am
      very thirsty."
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung himself into an easy chair, and Linda waited on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "where are the others? Where is the little Irish witch,
      and where is Molly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to say that Molly is in disgrace, as usual," said Mrs.
      Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear, dear!" said Mr. Hartrick; "we ought to send her to school, poor
      child! I am sorry for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I intended to give her quite a pleasant evening," said Mrs. Hartrick,
      "in honor of her cousin's arrival. She was in disgrace yesterday when Nora
      arrived; and I had thought of giving the girls a delightful evening. I had
      it all planned, and was going to ask the Challoners over; but really Molly
      is so incorrigible. She was very pert to me, although she did bring a
      better report from school; she used some of her objectionable language to
      Linda, and was more awkward even than usual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at the tablecloth, father," said Linda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think, Linda, you had better run out of the room," said Mr. Hartrick.
      He spoke in an annoyed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, father, I will go; but don't you want another cup of tea
      first?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother shall pour it out for me. Go, my dear&mdash;go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only, mother, is it necessary that we should not ask the Challoners
      because Molly is naughty? The rest of us would like to have them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will let you know presently, Linda," said her mother; and Linda was
      obliged, to her disgust, to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then, my dear," said Mr. Hartrick, "I don't at all like to call you
      over the coals; but I think it is a pity to speak against Molly so much as
      you do in her sister's presence. Linda is getting eaten up with conceit;
      she will be an intolerable woman by and by, so self-opinionated, and so
      pleased with herself. After all, poor Molly may have the best of it in the
      future; she is a fine child, notwithstanding her naughtiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought it likely you would take her part, George; and I am sorry,"
      answered Mrs. Hartrick in a melancholy tone; "but I am grieved to tell you
      that there is something else to follow. That little Irish girl is quite as
      cheeky, even more cheeky than Molly. I fear I must ask you to say a word
      to her; I shall require her to be respectful to me while she is here. She
      spoke very rudely to me just now, simply because I found it my duty to
      correct Molly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that won't do at all," said Mr. Hartrick. "I must speak to Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you would do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will. By the way, Grace, what a pretty creature she is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a beautiful little wildflower," said Mrs. Hartrick. "I have taken
      a great fancy to her, notwithstanding her rudeness. She has never had the
      smallest care; she has simply been allowed to grow up wild."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Nature has taken care of her," said Mr. Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear, of course; but you yourself know the advantage of bringing up
      a girl nicely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And no one is more capable of doing that than you are," said Mr.
      Hartrick, giving his wife an admiring glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear, for the compliment; but I should be glad if you would
      speak to Nora. Now that she is here, I have no doubt that we shall soon
      discipline her; and I should like her to pay quite a long visit&mdash;that
      is, of course, if she becomes conformable to my ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will be sure to do that, Grace," replied the husband. "I am glad you
      mean to be good to her, and to take her in hand, poor little lass!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought she might have some good masters and get some valuable lessons
      while she is here," said Mrs. Hartrick. "Would you believe it, George?&mdash;that
      little girl of sixteen calmly informed me that her education was finished.
      At the same time, she said she knew no language but her own, and just a
      smattering of that dead tongue, Irish. She cannot play; in short, she has
      no accomplishments whatever, and yet her education is finished. I must say
      I do not understand your sister. I should have thought that she was a
      little more like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There never was a more particular girl than Ellen used to be," said Mr.
      Hartrick; "but I must have a long talk with Nora. I'll see her this
      evening. I know she has a good deal she wants to talk to me about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good deal she wants to talk to you about, George?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, my dear; but I will explain presently. She is a proud little
      witch, and must not be coerced; we must remember that her spirit has never
      been broken. But I'll talk to her, I'll talk to her; leave the matter in
      my hands, Grace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, dear; she is your niece, remember."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; TWO DESCRIPTIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some of Nora's words must have sunk into Mrs. Hartrick's heart, for,
      rather to Molly's own astonishment, she was allowed to dress nicely for
      dinner, and to come down. Her somewhat heavy, dark face did not look to
      the best advantage. She wore a dress which did not suit her; her hair was
      awkwardly arranged; there was a scowl on her brow. She felt so sore and
      cross, after what she considered her brave efforts to be good during the
      morning, that she would almost rather have stayed up in her room. But Nora
      would not hear of that. Nora had rushed into Molly's room, and had begged
      her, for her sake, to come downstairs. Nora was looking quite charming in
      that pretty white frock which Mrs. O'Shanaghgan had purchased for her in
      Dublin. Her softly rounded figure, her dazzlingly fair complexion, were
      seen now for the first time to the best advantage. Her thick black hair
      was coiled up becomingly on her graceful little head, and, with a bunch of
      sweet peas at her belt, there could scarcely have been seen a prettier
      maiden. When she appeared in the drawing room, even Terence was forced to
      admit that he had seldom seen a more lovely girl than his sister. He went
      up to her and began to take notice of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry I was obliged to be out all day. I am studying the different
      museums very exhaustively," said Terence in that measured tone of his
      which drove poor Nora nearly wild. She replied to him somewhat pertly, and
      he retired once more into his shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty as my sister is," he soliloquized, "she really is such an ignorant
      girl that few fellows would care to speak to her. It is a sad pity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence, the last hope of the house of O'Shanaghgan, was heard to sigh
      profoundly. His aunt, Mrs. Hartrick, and his cousin Linda would,
      doubtless, sympathize with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinner was announced, and the meal went off very well. Molly was
      absolutely silent; Nora, taking her cue from her, hardly spoke; and Linda,
      Terence, and Mrs. Hartrick had it all their own way. But just as dessert
      was placed on the table, Mr. Hartrick looked at Nora and motioned to her
      to change seats and to come to one close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come now," he said, "we should like to hear your account of Castle
      O'Shanaghgan. Terence has told us all about it; but we should like to hear
      your version."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a most lovely place it must be," said Mrs. Hartrick from the other
      end of the table. "Your description, Terence, makes me quite long to see
      it; and if it were not that I am honestly very much afraid of the Irish
      peasantry, I should be glad to go there during the summer. But those
      terrible creatures, with their shillalahs, and their natural aptitude for
      firing on you from behind a hedge, are quite too fearful to contemplate. I
      could not run the risk of assassination from any of them. They seem to
      have a natural hatred for the English and&mdash;why, what is the matter,
      Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only it's not true," said Nora, her eyes flashing. "They are not a bit
      like that; they are the most warmhearted people in the whole world.
      Terence, have you been telling lies about your country? If you have, I am
      downright ashamed of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have not. I don't know what you mean," answered Terence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come, come, Nora!" said her uncle, patting her arm gently; but Nora's
      eyes blazed with fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not a bit true," she continued. "How can Aunt Grace think of that?
      The poor things have been driven to desperation, because&mdash;because
      their hearts have been trampled on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For instance," said Terence in a mocking voice, which fell like ice upon
      poor Nora's hot, indignant nature&mdash;"for instance, Andy Neil&mdash;he's
      a nice specimen, is he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Nora, "he&mdash;he is the exception. Don't talk of him,
      please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it," said Terence, laughing. "Nora wants to give us all the
      sweets, and to conceal all the bitters. Now, I am honest, whatever I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, are you?" said Nora, in indignation. "I should like to know," she
      continued, "what kind of place you have represented Castle O'Shanaghgan to
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know why I should be obliged to answer to you for what I say,
      Nora," cried her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You describe it now, Nora. We will hear your description," said her
      uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora sat quite still for a moment; then she raised her very dark-blue
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really want me to tell you about O'Shanaghgan?" she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, Nora. I am sure you can describe things very well," said her
      aunt, in an encouraging voice, from the other end of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will tell you," said Nora. She paused for a moment, then, to the
      astonishment and disgust of Mrs. Hartrick, rose to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot talk about it sitting down," she said. "There's the sea, you
      know&mdash;the wild, wild Atlantic. In the winter the breakers are&mdash;oh!
      I have sometimes seen them forty feet high."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Nora!" said Terence,
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true, Terry; the times when you don't like to go out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence retired into his shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen the waves like that; but, oh! in the summer they can be so
      sweet and conoodling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What in the world is that?" said Mrs. Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is one of our Irish words; there's no other way to express it. And
      then there are the cliffs, and the great caves, and the yellow, yellow
      sands, and the shells, and the seaweeds, and the fish, and the boating,
      and&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, Nora; you describe the sea just like any other sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but it is like no other sea," said Nora. "And then there are the
      mountains, their feet washed by the waves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite poetical," said Mrs. Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is; it is all poetry," said Nora. "You are not laughing at me, are
      you, Aunt Grace? I wish you could see those mountains and that sea, and
      then the home&mdash;O'Shanaghgan itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Nora; tell us," said her uncle, who did not laugh, and was much
      interested in the girl's description.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The home," cried Nora; "the great big, darling, empty house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Empty! What a very peculiar description!" said Mrs. Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is so nice," said Nora. "You don't knock over furniture when you
      walk about; and the dining-room table is so big that, even if you did
      spill a jug of milk, father would not be angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick uttered a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we are wild over there," continued Nora; "we have no
      conventionalities. We share and share alike; we don't mind whether we are
      rich or poor. We are poor&mdash;oh! frightfully poor; and we keep very few
      servants; and&mdash;and the place is bare; because it can be nothing but
      bare; but there's no place like O'Shanaghgan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what do you mean by bare?" said Mrs. Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bare?" said Nora. "I mean bare; very few carpets and very little
      furniture, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;But, oh! it's the hearts that are
      warm, and that is the only thing that matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be a right-down jolly place; and, by Jehoshaphat! I wish I was
      there," interrupted Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly!" said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, leave her alone for the present," said Mr. Hartrick. "But do you
      mean," he continued, looking at Nora in a distressed way, "that&mdash;that
      my sister lives in a house of that sort?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother?" said Nora. "Of course; she is father's wife, and my mother; she
      is the lady of O'Shanaghgan. It is a very proud position. We don't want
      grand furniture nor carpets to make it a proud position. She is father's
      wife, and he is O'Shanaghgan of Castle O'Shanaghgan. He is a sort of king,
      and he is descended from kings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Terence, I must say this does not at all coincide with your
      description," said his uncle, turning and looking his nephew full in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't wish to make things too bad, sir. Of course, we are not very
      rich over there; but still, Nora does exaggerate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Nora," said her uncle, suddenly turning and pulling her down
      to sit beside him, "you and I must have a little chat. We will just go and
      have it right away. You shall tell me your version of the story quite by
      ourselves." He then rose and drew her out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where shall we go?" he said when they stood for a moment in the
      conservatory, into which the big dining room opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really mean it?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mean what, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To talk to me about&mdash;about my letter? Do you mean it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I do, and there is no time like the present. Come&mdash;where
      shall we go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where we can be alone; where none of the prim English can interrupt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora, you must not be so prejudiced. We are not so bad as all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know it. I wish you were bad; it's because you are so awfully good
      that I hate&mdash;I mean, that I cannot get on with any of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child! you are a little wild creature. Come into my study; we shall
      be quite safe from interruption there."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; A COMPACT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartrick, still holding Nora's hand, took her down a corridor, and the
      next moment they found themselves in a large room, with oak bookcases and
      lined with oak throughout; but it was a stately sort of apartment, and it
      oppressed the girl as much as the rest of the house had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had thought," she murmured inwardly, "that his study would be a little
      bare. I cannot think how he can stand such closeness, so much furniture."
      She sighed as the thought came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More and more sighs, my little Irish girl," said Mr. Hartrick. "Why, what
      is the matter with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot breathe; but I'll soon get accustomed to it," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cannot breathe? Are you subject to asthma, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, no; but there is so much furniture, and I am accustomed to so
      little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Nora; but now you must pull yourself together, and try to be
      broad-minded enough to take us English folk as we are. We are not wild; we
      are civilized. Our houses are not bare; but I presume you must consider
      them comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," said Nora; "yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you dislike comfortable houses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hate them!" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, dear child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would if you were me&mdash;wouldn't you, Uncle George?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose if I were you I should feel as you do, Nora. I must honestly
      say I am very thankful I am not you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora did not reply at all to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, at home now," she said, "the moon is getting up, and it is making a
      path of silver on the waves, and it is touching the head of Slieve
      Nagorna. The dear old Slieve generally keeps his snow nightcap on, and I
      dare say he has it by now. In very hot weather, sometimes, it melts and
      disappears; but probably he has got his first coat of snow by now, just on
      his very top, you know. Then, when the moon shines on it and then on the
      water&mdash;why, don't you think, Uncle George, you would rather look at
      Slieve Nagorna, with the snow on him and the moon touching his forehead,
      and the path of silver on the water, than&mdash;than be just comfortable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see why I should not have both," said Mr. Hartrick after a pause;
      "the silver path on the water and the grand look of Slieve Nagorna (I can
      quite fancy what he is like from your description, Nora), and also have a
      house nicely furnished, and good things to eat, and&mdash;&mdash;. But I
      see we are at daggers drawn, my dear niece. Now, please tell me what your
      letter means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really want me to tell you now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know why I have really come here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said something in your letter; but you did not explain yourself very
      clearly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came here," said Nora, "for a short visit. I want to go back again
      soon. Time is flying. Already a month of the three months is over. In two
      months' time the blow will fall unless&mdash;unless you, Uncle George,
      avert it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The blow, dear? What blow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are going," said Nora&mdash;she held out both her hands&mdash;"the
      place, the sea, the mountains, the home of our ancestors, they are going
      unless&mdash;unless you help us, Uncle George."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Nora, you are very melodramatic; you must try and talk plain
      English. Do you mean to say that Castle O'Shanaghgan&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's it," said Nora; "it is mortgaged. I don't quite know what
      mortgaged means, but it is something very bad; and unless father can get a
      great deal of money&mdash;I don't know how much, but a good deal&mdash;before
      two months are up, the man to whom Castle O'Shanaghgan is mortgaged will
      take possession of it. He is a horrid Englishman; but he will go there,
      and he will turn father out, and mother out, and me&mdash;oh, Terence
      doesn't matter. Terence never was an Irishman&mdash;never, never; but he
      will turn us out. We will go away. Oh, it does not greatly matter for me,
      because I am young; and it does not greatly matter for mother, because she
      is an English woman. Oh, yes, Uncle George, she is just like you&mdash;she
      likes comfort; she likes richly furnished rooms; but she is my mother, and
      of course I love her; she will stand it, for she will think perhaps we
      will come here to this country. But it is father I am thinking of, the old
      lion, the old king, the dear, grand old father. He won't understand, he'll
      be so puzzled. No other place will suit him; he won't say a word; it's not
      the way of the O'Shanaghgans to grumble. He won't utter a word; he will go
      away, and he will&mdash;die. His heart will be broken; he will die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora, my dear child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," said Nora. Her face was ghastly white; her words came out in
      broken sobs. "I see him, Uncle George; every night I see him, with his
      bowed head, and his broken heart, and his steps getting slower and slower.
      He'll be so puzzled, for he is such a true Irishman, Uncle George. You
      don't know what we are&mdash;happy one day, miserable the next. He thinks
      somehow, somehow, that the money will be paid. But, oh, Uncle George!&mdash;I
      suppose I have got a little bit of the English in me after all&mdash;I
      know it will not be paid, that no one will lend it to him, not any of his
      old friends and cronies; and he will have to go, and it will break his
      heart, unless, unless you help him. I thought of you; I guessed you must
      be rich. I see now that you are very rich. Oh, how rich!&mdash;rich enough
      for carriages, and thick carpets, and easy-chairs, and tables, and grand
      dresses, and&mdash;and all those sort of things; and you will help&mdash;won't
      you? Please, do! please, do! You'll be so glad some day that you helped
      the old king, and saved him from dying of a broken heart. Please, help
      him, Uncle George."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear little girl!" said Mr. Hartrick. He was really affected by Nora's
      speech; it was wild; it was unconventional; there was a great deal of
      false sentiment about it; but the child herself was true, and her eyes
      were beautiful, and she looked graceful, and young, and full of passion,
      almost primeval passion, as she stood there before him. Then she believed
      in him. If she did not believe in anyone else in the house, she believed
      in him. She thought that if she asked him he would help.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, tell me," he said after a pause, "does your mother know what you
      have come here for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother? Certainly not; I told you in my letter that you must not breathe
      a word of it to mother; and father does not know. No one knows but I&mdash;Nora,
      I myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This has been completely your own idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Completely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a brave girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know about being brave. I had to do something. If you
      belonged to Patrick O'Shanaghgan you would do something for him too. Have
      you ever seen him, Uncle George?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, at the time of my sister's wedding, but not since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was as handsome a fellow as I ever laid eyes on, and Irish through and
      through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. What else would he be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not seen him since. My sister, poor Ellen, she was a beautiful
      girl when she was young, Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is stately, like a queen," said Nora. "We all admire her very, very
      much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And love her, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, of course I love mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not as well as your father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could not, Uncle George, if you knew father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I shall not ask any more. You really do want me to help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you can; if it will not cost you too much money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you mean that your father is absolutely, downright poor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I suppose so. I don't think that matters a bit. We wouldn't like to
      be rich, neither father nor I; but we do want to keep O'Shanaghgan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even without carpets and chairs and tables?" said Mr. Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We don't care about carpets and chairs and tables," said Nora. "We want
      to keep O'Shanaghgan, the place where father was born and I was born."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, look here, Nora. I can make you no promises just now; but I respect
      you, my dear, and I will certainly do something&mdash;what I cannot
      possibly tell you, for I must look into this matter for myself. But I will
      do this: I will go to O'Shanaghgan this week and see my sister, and find
      out from the Squire what really is wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will?" said Nora. She thought quickly. Her father would hate it; but,
      after all, it was the only chance. Even she had sufficient common sense to
      know that Mr. Hartrick could not help unless he went to the old place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you will do it when you see it," she said, with sudden rapture. "And
      you'll take me home with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think not, Nora. Now that you are here you must stay. I am fond
      of you, my little girl, although I know very little about you; but I do
      think that you have very mistaken ideas. I want you to love your English
      cousins for your mother's sake, and to love their home for your mother's
      sake also; and I should like you to have a few lessons, and to take some
      hints from your Aunt Grace, for you are wild, and need training. If I go
      to O'Shanaghgan for you, will you stay at The Laurels for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do anything, anything for you, if you save father," said Nora. She
      fell on her knees before her uncle could prevent her, took his hand, and
      kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it is a compact," said Mr. Hartrick; "but remember I only promise to
      go. I cannot make any promises to help your father until I have seen him."

      CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; SHE WILL SOON TAME DOWN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I am going to Ireland to-morrow, Grace," said Mr. Hartrick to his wife
      that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Ireland!" she cried. "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see my sister Ellen. I feel that I have neglected her too long.
      I shall run over to O'Shanaghgan, and stay there for two or three nights."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you doing this, George?" said Mrs. Hartrick very slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartrick was silent for a moment; then he said gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard bad news from that child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, from Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Terence has never given us bad news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terence is not a patch upon Nora, my dear Grace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There I cannot agree with you. I infinitely prefer Terence to Nora," was
      Mrs. Hartrick's calm reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought you admired the child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I admire what the child may become," was the cautious answer. "I
      cannot admire a perfectly wild girl, who has no idea of self-discipline or
      self-restraint. And remember one thing, George: whatever she says to you,
      you must take, to use a vulgarism, with a grain of salt. An Irish girl
      cannot help exaggerating. She has doubtless exaggerated the condition of
      things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only pray God she has," was Mr. Hartrick's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If things are even half as bad as she represents them, it is high time
      that I should pay my sister a visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? What does she say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has given me a picture of the state of affairs at that house which
      wrings my heart, Grace. To think that my beautiful sister Ellen should be
      subjected to such discomforts, to such miseries, is intolerable. I intend
      to go to O'Shanaghgan to-morrow, and will see how matters are for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick was again silent for a moment or two; then she said gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubtless you are right to do this; but I hope, while you are away, you
      will do nothing rash."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that, from the little I have seen of Nora, she is a very impetuous
      creature, and has tried perhaps to wring a promise from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you quite simply what she has said, Grace, and then you will
      understand. She says her father has mortgaged the Castle evidently up to
      the hilt. The mortgagees will foreclose in a couple of months, unless
      money can be found to buy them off. Now, it has just occurred to me that I
      might buy Castle O'Shanaghgan for ourselves as a sort of summer residence,
      put it in order, and allow Patrick O'Shanaghgan to live there, and my
      sister. By and by the place can go to Terence, as we have no son of our
      own. I have plenty of money. What do you think of this suggestion, Grace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might not be a bad one," said Mrs. Hartrick; "but I could not possibly
      go to a place of that sort unless it were put into proper repair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, I believe, in reality a fine old place, and the grounds are
      beautiful," said Mr. Hartrick. "A few thousand pounds would put it into
      order, and we could furnish it from Dublin. You could have a great many
      guests there, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what about the O'Shanaghgans themselves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps they would go somewhere else for the couple of months we
      should need to occupy the house during the summer. Anyhow, I feel that I
      must do something for Ellen's sake; but I will let you know more after I
      have been there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick asked a few more questions. After a time she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Nora to remain here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I was going to speak to you about that. It is a sad pity that so
      pretty a girl should grow up wild. We had better keep her with us for the
      next two or three years. She will soon tame down and learn our English
      habits; then, with her undeniable Irish charm and great beauty, she will
      be able to do something with her life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be quite pleased to have her," said Mrs. Hartrick in a cordial
      tone. "I like training young girls, and Nora is the sort who would do me
      credit if she really were willing to take pains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure she will be; she is an honest little soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see you are bewitched by her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not bewitched; but I admire honesty and candor, and the child has got
      both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well!" said Mrs. Hartrick, "if it is arranged that Nora is to stay
      here, I will go and see Miss Flowers at Linda's and Molly's school
      to-morrow, and ask if Nora can be admitted as a pupil. There is no use in
      losing time, and she may as well start her lessons next week. By all
      means, George, go and do your best for the poor things. Of course your
      sister ought not to be allowed to be in money difficulties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think not," said Mr. Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Mr. Hartrick bade Nora and his own family good-by, and
      started on his expedition to Ireland. Nora was quivering with impatience.
      When she had seen the last of him she turned back into the house, and was
      there met by her brother Terence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, Nora. I want to speak to you," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed him into the nearest room. He closed the door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask what you have been saying to Uncle George?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may ask, of course, Terry; but I don't mean to tell you," answered
      Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is because of you he is going to Ireland?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is because of something I have said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you think our mother will like it? You know how proud she is; how
      all these years she has determined to put a good face on things, and not
      to allow her relations in England to know the truth. I have followed her
      cue, and have been careful to make the very best of things at Castle
      O'Shanaghgan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is easy to tell lies," said Nora, with scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora, you talk in a very silly way, and I often have no patience with
      you," answered her brother. "If I have regard to my mother's feelings, why
      should you despise me? You are supposed to consider our father's
      feelings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very different; the whole thing is different," said Nora. She
      flushed, bit her lip, and then turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must hear me," said Terence, looking at her with some impatience;
      "you must, you shall. You are quite intolerable with your conceit and your
      silly, silly Irish ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go on. What have you to say to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I think you were guilty of dishonor in talking as you did at dinner
      last night. You spoke of the place and the poverty in a way which quite
      put me to the blush. I hope in future, while you are here, you will cease
      to run the O'Shanaghgans down. It is not worthy of you, Nora, and I am
      ashamed of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run them down&mdash;I?" said poor Nora in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment; she was making a great effort to recover her
      equanimity. Was Terence right? Had she done wrong to speak before her aunt
      and cousins as she had done? Of course her uncle was different; it was
      absolutely necessary that he at least should know the truth. A distressful
      sense of dismay at her own impetuosity came over her. Terence watched her
      narrowly. He was fond of Nora in his heart of hearts, and also proud of
      her; and now that he saw she was really sorry he went up to her, put his
      arm round her neck, and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, little girl," he said, "you are young. Try to be guided by me
      in future, and do not give yourself away. We Irish wear our hearts on our
      sleeves, and that sort of thing does not go down in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how I hate this cold England!" said the Irish girl, with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are again, all your feelings expressed too broadly. You will
      never endure life if you go on as you have begun, Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terence," said Nora, looking up at him, "when are you going home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When am I going home? Thank you, I am very comfortable here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think that just at present, when father is in trouble, his only
      son, the heir of O'Shanaghgan, ought to be with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor old O'Shanaghgan," said the lad, with impatience; "you think that it
      comprises the whole of the world. I tell you what it is, Nora, I am made
      differently, and I infinitely prefer England. My uncle has been kind
      enough to offer me a small post in his business. Did I not tell you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; I never knew what my uncle's business was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a merchant prince, Nora; an enormously rich man. He owns warehouses
      upon warehouses. He has offered me a post in one&mdash;a very good post,
      and a certain income."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you mean to accept?" said Nora, her eyes flashing fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am writing to mother on the subject. I think it would be well to
      do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, an O'Shanaghgan, will descend to trade?" replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, folly! folly! Nora, your ideas are really too antiquated."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora did not speak at all for a moment; then she walked toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot understand you," she said. "I am awfully sorry. I was born
      different; I was made different. I cannot understand why you should bring
      dishonor to the old place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By earning a little money to keep us all from beggary," retorted the lad
      in a bitter tone; but Nora did not hear him; she had left the room. Her
      eyes were smarting with unshed tears. She went out into the shrubbery in
      search of Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But for Molly I should break my heart," she thought.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. &mdash; STEPHANOTIE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick made all necessary arrangements, and on the following Monday
      Nora accompanied her cousin to school. Molly was much delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I shall be able to work," she said, "and I won't be guilty of slang
      when you are by. Don't whisper it to Linda. She would be in the seventh
      heaven of bliss, and I detest pleasing her; but I would do anything in the
      world for you, Nora creena."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora gave her cousin's arm an affectionate squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never been to school," said Nora; "you must instruct me what I am
      to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear, dear!" said Molly, "you won't need instruction; you are as
      sharp and smart as any girl could be. You'll be a little puzzled at first
      about the different classes, and I'll give you hints about how to take
      notes and all that sort of thing. But you will quickly get into the way of
      it, and then you'll learn like a house on fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you two wouldn't whisper together so much," said Linda in an
      annoyed voice. "I am going over my French parsing to myself, and you do
      interrupt me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then walk a little farther away from us," said Molly rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned once more to her cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will introduce you to the very nicest girls in my form," she said. "I
      do hope you'll be put into my form, for then in the evenings you and I can
      do our work together. I expect you know about as much as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's just it&mdash;I don't," said Nora. "I have not learned a bit
      in the school way. I had a governess for a time, but she did not know a
      great deal. Of course mother taught me too; but I have not had advantages.
      I should not be surprised if I were put into the lowest form."
    </p>
    <p>
      They now arrived at the school, and a few minutes later Nora found herself
      in a huge classroom in which about sixty other girls were assembled. Miss
      Flowers presently sent a pupil-teacher to ask Miss O'Shanaghgan to have an
      interview with her in her private room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Flowers was about fifty years of age. She had white hair, calm,
      large, well-opened blue eyes, a steadfast mouth, and a gracious and at the
      same time dignified manner. She was not exactly beautiful; but she had the
      sort of face which most girls respected and which many loved. Nora looked
      earnestly at her, and in her wild, impulsive Irish fashion, gave her heart
      on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your name, my dear?" said the head-mistress kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora told it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are Irish, Mrs. Hartrick tells me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Miss Flowers, I have lived all my life in Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must find out what sort of instruction you have had. Have you ever been
      at school before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How old are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sixteen, Miss Flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What things have you been taught?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "English subjects of different sorts," replied Nora. "A little music&mdash;oh,
      I love music, I do love music!&mdash;and a little French; and I can speak
      Irish," she added, raising her beautiful, dark-blue eyes, and fixing them
      on the face of the head-mistress. That winsome face touched Miss Flowers'
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do what I can for you," she said. "For the present you had better
      study alone. At the end of a week or so I shall be able to determine what
      form to put you in. Now, go back to the schoolroom and ask Miss Goring to
      come to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Goring was the English mistress. Miss Flowers saw her alone for a
      minute or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do what you can for the Irish girl," she said. "She is a very pretty
      creature; she is evidently ignorant; but I think she has plenty of
      talent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Goring went back, and during the rest of the morning devoted herself
      to Nora. Nora had varied and strange acquirements at her finger's ends.
      She was up in all sorts of folk lore; she could clothe her speech in
      picturesque and striking language. She could repeat poetry from Sir Walter
      Scott, from Shakspere, from the old Irish bards themselves; but her
      grammar was defective, although her reading aloud was very pretty and
      sweet. Her knowledge of history was vague, and might be best described by
      the expression, up and down. She knew all about the Waldenses; she had a
      vivid picture in her mind's eye of St. Bartholomew's Eve. The French
      Revolution appalled and, at the same time, attracted her. The death of
      Charles I. drew tears from her eyes; but she knew nothing whatever of the
      chronological arrangements of history; and the youngest girl in the school
      could have put her to shame with regard to the Magna Charta. It was just
      the same with every branch of knowledge which Nora had even a smattering
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the great test of all came&mdash;could she play or could she not?
      She had spoken often of her passionate love for music. Miss Goring took
      her into the drawing room, away from the other girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not supposed to be musical," she said, "but I think I know music
      when I hear it. If you have talent, you shall have plenty of advantages
      here. Now, sit down and play something for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! At that piano?" said Nora, her eyes sparkling. Miss Goring had
      opened a magnificent Broadwood grand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said. "It is rather daring of me to bring you here; but I want
      you to have fair play."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never played on a really good piano in my life," said Nora. "May I
      venture?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I do not believe you will injure it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I play as loud as I like, and as soft as I like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. You may play exactly as you please; only play with all your
      heart. You will be taught scientific music doubtless; but I want to know
      what you can do without education, at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora sat down. At first she felt a little shy, and all her surroundings
      were so strange, the piano was so big; she touched it with her small,
      taper fingers, and it seemed to her that the deep, soft notes were going
      to overpower her. Then she looked at Miss Goring and felt uncomfortable;
      but she touched the notes again, and she began to forget the room, and
      Miss Goring, and the grand piano; and the soul of music stood in her eyes
      and touched the tips of her fingers. The music was quite unclassical,
      quite unconventional; but it was music&mdash;a wild kind of wailing chant&mdash;the
      notes of the Banshee itself. Nora played on, and the tears filled her eyes
      and streamed down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it hurts so!" she said at last, and she looked full up at Miss
      Goring. Behold, the cold, gray eyes of the English teacher were also full
      of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You terrify me," she said. "Where did you hear anything like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the wail of the Banshee. Shall I play any more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing more so eerie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then may I sing for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you sing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was never taught; but I think I can sing." Nora struck a few chords
      again. She sang the pathetic words, "She is Far from the Land," and Miss
      Goring felt the tears filling her eyes once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word!" she said, as she led her pupil back to the schoolroom,
      "you can play and you can sing; you have music in you. It would be worth
      while to give you good lessons."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora's musical education was now taken up with vigor. Miss Goring spoke to
      Miss Flowers about it, and Miss Flowers communicated with Mrs. Hartrick;
      and Mrs. Hartrick was extremely pleased to find that she had a musical
      genius in her midst, and determined to give that same musical genius every
      chance. Accordingly, the very best master in the school arranged to give
      Nora lessons, and a mistress of striking ability took her also in hand.
      Nora's wild music, the music that came from her heart, and the song that
      bubbled from her lips, were absolutely silenced. She must not sing at
      will; she must on no account play at will. The dullest of exercises were
      given to her for the purpose of molding her fingers, and the dullest of
      voice exercises were also given to her for the purpose of molding her
      voice. She struggled against the discipline, and hated it. She was
      essentially a child of nature, and this first putting on of the chains of
      education was the reverse of pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Molly," she said, "what is the good of singing those hateful,
      screaming exercises, and those scales? They are too detestable, and those
      little twists and turns. My fingers absolutely feel quite nervous. What is
      the use? What is the use?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly also sighed and said, "What is the use?" But then the musical
      mistress and the great master looked at Nora all over when she made
      similar remarks, and would not even vouchsafe to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father would never be soothed with that sort of music," she said. "I
      think he would be very glad we had not a good piano. Oh, Molly, what does
      it all mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said Molly. "It's like all other education, nothing but
      grind, grind; but I suppose something will come of it in the long run."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you talking about, girls?" said Mrs. Hartrick, who just then
      appeared upon the scene. "Nora, I am pleased; to get very good reports of
      your music."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Nora, "I am glad you have come, Aunt Grace; and I shall be able
      to speak to you. Must I learn what takes all the music out of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silly child. There is only one road to a sound musical education, and
      that is the road of toil. At present you play by ear, and sing by ear. You
      have talent; but it must be cultivated. Just believe that your elders know
      what they are about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora did not say anything. Mrs. Hartrick, after looking at her gravely for
      a moment, continued her gentle walk round the shrubbery. Molly uttered a
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no good, Nora," she said. "You'll have to go through with it. I
      suppose it is the only way; but it's hard to believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, at any rate, I enjoy other things in my school life," said Nora.
      "Miss Goring is so nice, and I quite love Miss Flowers; and, after all, I
      am in your form, Molly, and we do like doing our lessons together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure we do; life is quite a different thing for me since you have
      come here," was Molly's retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have been very good indeed about your naughty words, you know,"
      said Nora, nestling up to her cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I? Well, it's owing to you. You see, now, I have someone to help me&mdash;someone
      to understand me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Nora; "but I won't be here very long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not here very long! Why, you must. What is the use of beginning school
      and then stopping it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "School or no school, my place is by father's side. It is a long, long
      time since we heard from Uncle George. As soon as ever he comes back I
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father has been a whole month in Ireland now," said Molly. "I cannot
      imagine what he is doing. I think mother fidgets rather. She has very long
      letters from him, and&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, do you know," said Nora, "that father has not written to me once&mdash;no,
      not once since Uncle George went over? I am absolutely in the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder you stand it," said Molly. "You are so impetuous. I cannot
      imagine why you don't fly back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could not? What is there to hinder you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have given my word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your word? To whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To your father. He went to Ireland to please me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, did he? That's exciting," said Molly. "Father went to Ireland to
      please a little chit like you. Now, what does this mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means exactly what I have said. He went because I begged him to;
      because I explained things to him, and he said he would go. But he made a
      condition, and I am bound to stick to my part of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that was&mdash;&mdash;How your eyes shine, Nora!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was, that I am to stay patiently here, and get as English as ever I
      can. Oh! I must stick to my part of the bargain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I cannot say you look very happy," said Molly, "although you are
      such a favorite at the school. If I was not very fond of you myself I
      should be jealous. If I had a friend whom I really worshiped, before you
      appeared on the scene, it was Stephanotie Miller, the American girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, isn't she charming?" said Nora. "She makes me laugh. I am sure she
      has Irish blood in her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it; she's a Yankee of the Yankees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she has been sent to school to get tame, just as I have been," said
      Nora; "but I don't want you to lose her friendship. After all, I care very
      little for anyone in the school but you, Molly; only Stephanotie makes me
      laugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have her to tea tomorrow. I'll run in now and ask mother. I shan't
      mind a bit if you are not going quite to take her from me. After all, she
      can be friends with both of us. I'll run into the house this moment, and
      ask mother if we may have Stephanotie to tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly rushed into the house. Her mother was seated in the morning room,
      busily writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, well?" she said. "I hear you&mdash;you need not bang the
      door. What is it, Molly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother! do look up and listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick raised her head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have behaved a great deal better lately&mdash;have I not, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You certainly have, Molly; and I am pleased with you. If you would
      restrain some of your impetuosity, I should be glad to tell you how
      pleased I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all owing to Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Nora, my dear! Nora is as wild as you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same, it is owing to Nora; and she is not as wild as I am. I mean
      that I have been downright vulgar; but if you think there is one trace of
      that in little Nora, it is because you do not know her a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your special request, Molly? I am very busy just now, and cannot
      discuss your cousin's character. You have improved, and I am pleased with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, if you are pleased with me, mother, will you do me a favor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stephanotie Miller has never been at our house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stephanotie Miller. What an outlandish name! Who is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a dear, jolly, sweet, handsome American girl. She came to school
      last term, and she is in the same form with Nora and me; and we both adore
      her, yes we do. Whatever she does, and whatever she says, we think simply
      perfection; and we want to ask her here. She is staying with a rather
      tiresome aunt, in a little house in the village, and she has come over to
      be Englishized. May she have tea with us tomorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will inquire about her from Miss Flowers; and if she seems to be a nice
      girl I shall have no objection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we want her to come tomorrow," said Molly. "It is Saturday, you know,
      and a whole holiday. We thought she might come to lunch, or, if you
      objected to that, immediately after lunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what about Linda? Does Linda like her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Moses, no!" said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother! do forgive me, and don't say she mustn't come because I said
      'Holy Moses.' It's all Linda; she excites the vulgar in me always. But may
      Stephie come, mother? You are always having Linda's friends here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not be reproved by you, Molly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, please, dear mother, let her come. Nora and I want her so badly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, dear, I will try and see Miss Flowers tomorrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you judge of her for yourself, mother? There never was a better
      judge than you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      This judicious flattery had its effect on Mrs. Hartrick, She sat quite
      still for a moment, pondering. After all, to be a pupil at Mrs. Flowers'
      school was in itself a certificate of respectability, and Molly had been
      very good lately&mdash;that is, for her; and if she and Nora wanted a
      special friend to spend the afternoon with them, it would be possible for
      Mrs. Hartrick quickly to decide whether the invitation was to be repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," she said, looking at her daughter, "for this once you may
      have her; and as you have wisely expressed it, Molly, I can judge for
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you, thank you, mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly rushed out of the room. She was flying headlong down the passage,
      when she came plump up against Linda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, what is up?" said that young person. "Really, Molly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hurrah! I have won my way for once," said Molly. "Stephanotie is
      coming tomorrow to spend the whole afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stephanotie&mdash;that horrid Yankee?" said Linda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horrid Yankee yourself!" was Molly's vulgar retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she cannot come. I have asked Mabel and Rose Armitage, and you know
      they cannot stand Stephanotie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you, and your Mabel and Rose, can keep away from Stephanotie&mdash;that's
      all," said Molly. "Anyhow, she is coming. Don't keep me. I must tell
      Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda made way for her sister to fly past her, as she afterward expressed
      it, like a whirlwind. She stood still for a moment in deep consideration.
      Stephanotie was a daring, bright, go-ahead young person, and had she ever
      taken, in the very least, to Linda, Linda would have worshiped her.
      Stephanotie was extremely rich, and the bouquets she brought to school,
      and the bon-bons she kept in her pocket, and the pretty trinkets she wore,
      and the dresses she exhibited had fascinated Linda more than once. For,
      rich as the Hartricks were, Mrs. Hartrick had far too good taste to allow
      her daughters more pocket-money, or more trinkets, or more bon-bons than
      their companions. Linda, in her heart of hearts, had greatly rebelled
      against her mother's rule in this particular, and had envied Stephanotie
      what she called her free life. But Stephanotie had never taken to Linda,
      and she had taken to Molly, and still more had she taken to Nora; and, in
      consequence, Linda pretended to hate her, and whenever she had an
      opportunity used to run her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda and her friends, Rose and Mabel Armitage, with several other girls,
      formed quite a clique in the school against Stephanotie and what she
      termed her "set"; and now to think that this very objectionable American
      girl was to spend the next day at The Laurels because Molly, forsooth!
      wished it, was quite intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda thought for a moment, then went into the room where her mother was
      busy writing. Mrs. Hartrick had just finished her letter. She looked up
      when Linda approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, darling?" she said. Mrs. Hartrick was very fond of Linda, and
      petted her a great deal more than Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother! I am vexed," said Linda. "Is it quite settled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is what settled, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it quite settled that Stephanotie is to come to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, I was going to ask you about her, Linda. What sort of girl is
      she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not wish to say anything against my schoolfellows, mother; but if
      you could only see her&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick raised her eyebrows in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly has taken so violently to her," she answered, "and so has Nora; and
      I thought that just for once&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you have given leave, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my friends are coming&mdash;those two charming girls, the Armitages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear; I greatly admire both the Armitage girls. I am glad they are
      coming; but why should not Miss Miller come also?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only, she is not in their 'set,' mother&mdash;that is all. I wish&mdash;I
      do wish you would ask her to postpone her visit. If she must come, let her
      come another Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will think about it," said Mrs. Hartrick. "I have certainly promised
      and&mdash;&mdash;But I will think about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda saw that she could not press her mother any further. She went away
      in great disquietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be done?" she thought. "If only mother would speak to Molly at
      once; but Molly is so impetuous; and once Stephanotie is asked, there will
      be no getting out of it. She is just the sort of girl to tell that
      unpleasant story about me, too. If mother knew that, why, I should at last
      be in her black books. Well, whatever happens, Stephanotie must not be
      asked to spend the afternoon here to-morrow. I must somehow contrive to
      put some obstacle in the way."

      CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; THE ROSE-COLORED DRESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Molly rushed off to Nora. "Linda means mischief, and I must put
      my foot down immediately," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Molly, what is up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put on your hat, darling, and come with me as fast as ever you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother has given in about Stephanotie. Linda will put her finger in the
      pie if she possibly can. I mean Stephanotie to get her invitation within
      the next five minutes. Now, then, come along, Nora. Do be quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick never allowed the girls to go out except very neatly
      dressed; but on this occasion they were seen tearing down the road with
      their garden hats on and minus their gloves. Had anyone from The Laurels
      observed them, good-by to Molly's liberty for many a long day. No one did,
      however. Linda during the critical moment was closeted with her mother.
      When she reappeared the girls were halfway to the village. They reached it
      in good time, and arrived at the house of Miss Truefitt, Stephanotie's
      aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Truefitt was an old-fashioned and precise little lady. She had gone
      through a great deal of trouble since the arrival of her niece, and often,
      as she expressed it, did not know whether she stood on her head or her
      heels; but she was fond of Stephanotie, who, notwithstanding her wild
      ways, was very affectionate and very taking. And now, when she saw Molly
      and Nora appearing, she herself entered the hall and opened the door for
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dears," she said, "Stephie is in her bedroom; she has a
      headache, and wanted to lie down for a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just let me run up to her. I won't keep her a minute," said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in here with me," said Miss Truefitt to Nora. She opened the door of
      her neat little parlor. Nora entered. The room was full of gay pictures
      and gay books, and scattered here and there were very large boxes of
      bon-bons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How she can eat them all is what puzzles me," said Miss Truefitt; "she
      seems to live on them. The quantity she demolishes would wreck the health
      of any English girl. Ah, here comes Molly."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Molly did not come downstairs alone; the American girl was with her.
      Stephanotie rushed into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to The Laurels to-morrow, auntie. I am going quite early; this
      dear old Molly has asked me. You guess I'll have a good time. There will
      be a box of bon-bons for Nora, sweet little Irish Nora; and a box for dear
      little Molly, a true native of England, and a fine specimen to boot. Oh,
      we shall have a nice time; and I am so glad I am asked!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very kind of Mrs. Hartrick to send you an invitation, Stephie,"
      said her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, bother that, Aunt Violet! You know perfectly well she would not ask
      me if Molly and Nora had not got it out of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we did try our best and most conoodling ways," said Nora in a soft
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, didn't you, you little Irish witch; and I guess you won, too. Well,
      I'm going; we'll have a jolly lark with Linda. If for no other reason, I
      should be glad to go to upset her apple cart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, Stephie! you are very coarse and vulgar," said Miss Truefitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it, auntie. Have a bon-bon, do." Stephanotie rushed across
      the room, opened a big box of bon-bons, and presented one, as if it were a
      pistol, full in Miss Truefitt's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, thank you, my dear!" said that lady, backing; "the indigestion I
      have already got owing to the way you have forced your bon-bons upon me
      has almost wrecked my health. I have lost all appetite. Dear me, Stephie!
      I wish you would not be so dreadfully American."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The process of Englishizing me is a slow one," said Stephanotie. She
      turned, walked up to the glass, and surveyed herself. She was dressed in
      rich brown velveteen, made to fit her lissome figure. Her hair was of an
      almost fiery red, and surrounded her face like a halo; her eyes were very
      bright china-blue, and she had a dazzlingly fair complexion. There were
      people who thought Stephanotie pretty; there were others who did not
      admire her at all. She had a go-ahead, very independent manner, and was
      the sort of girl who would be idolized by the weaker members of the
      school. Molly, however, was by no means a weak member of the school, nor,
      for that matter, was Nora, and they both took great pleasure out of
      Stephanotie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My bark is worse than my bite," said that young person. "I am something
      like you, Molly. I am a bit of a scorcher; but there, when I am trained in
      properly I'll be one of the best of good creatures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you are booked for to-morrow now," said Molly; "and Jehoshaphat! if
      you don't come in time&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Molly!" whispered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, I won't say it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Miss Truefitt looked much shocked. Molly and Nora bade her good-by,
      and nodded to Stephanotie, who stood upon the doorstep and watched them
      down the street; then she returned to her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did think," said Miss Truefitt slowly, "that the girls belonging to
      your school were ladylike; but to come here without gloves, and that
      eldest girl, Miss Hartrick, to use such a shocking expression."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, bless you, Aunt Vi! it's nothing to the expressions she uses at
      school. She's a perfect horror of a girl, and I like her for that very
      reason. It is that horrid little Linda would please you; and I must say I
      am sorry for your taste."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Stephanotie went upstairs to arrange her wardrobe for the next day.
She had long wished to visit Molly's home. The Laurels was one of
the prettiest places in the neighborhood, and Molly and Linda were
considered as among the smartest girls at the school. Stephanotie wished
to be hand-and-glove with Molly, not because she was supposed to be
rich, or respectable, or anything else, but simply because her nature
fitted to that of the wild, enthusiastic American girl. But, all the
same, now that she had got the <i>entrée</i>, as she expressed it, of the
Hartricks' home, she intended to make a sensation.

 "When I do the thing I may as well do it properly," she said to
herself. "I will make them open their eyes. I have watched Mrs. Hartrick
in church; and, oh dear me! have not I longed to give her a poke in the
back. And as to Linda, she thinks a great deal of her dress. She
does not know what mine will be when I take out my very best and most
fascinating gown."
</pre>
    <p>
      Accordingly Stephanotie rifled her trunk, and from its depths she produced
      a robe which would, as she said, make the members of The Laurels sit up.
      It was made of rose-colored silk, and trimmed with quantities of cream
      lace. The skirt had many little flounces on it, and each was edged with
      lace. The bodice was cut rather low in the neck, and the sleeves did not
      come down anything like as far as the wrists. The rose-colored silk with
      its cream lace trimmings was altogether the sort of dress which might be
      worn in the evening; but daring Stephanotie intended to appear in it in
      the morning. She would encircle her waist with a cream-colored sash, very
      broad, and with much lace upon it; and would wear many-colored beads round
      her neck, and many bracelets on her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole will have a stylish effect, and will at any rate distinguish me
      from everyone else," was her inward comment. She shook out the dress, and
      then rang the bell. One of the servants appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to have this robe ironed and made as presentable as possible,"
      said Stephanotie; "see you have it all done and put in my wardrobe ready
      for wear tonight. I guess it will fetch 'em," she added, and then she
      rushed like a whirlwind into the presence of Miss Truefitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Auntie," she said, "would you like to see me done up in style?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, I am sure, my dear," said Miss Truefitt, looking at her
      with nervous eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear, Aunt Vi! if you were to see mother now you wouldn't know her;
      she is wonderfully addicted to the pleasures of the toilet. There is
      nothing so fascinating as the pleasures of the toilet when once you yield
      to its charms. She rigged me up pretty smart before I left New York, and I
      am going to wear my rose-colored silk with the cream lace to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are not going to an evening party, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but I shall stay all the evening, and I know I'll look killing. The
      dress suits me down to the ground. It is one of my fads always to be in
      something red; it seems to harmonize with my hair."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Truefitt uttered a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you sighing for, Aunt Vi?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, dear; only please don't offer me a bon-bon. The mere sight of
      those boxes gives me a feeling of nausea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have not tried the crystallized figs," cried Stephanotie; "they
      are wonderfully good; and if you feel nausea a peppermint-drop will set
      you right. I have a kind of peppermint chocolate in this box which is
      extremely stimulating to the digestive organs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Stephie. I beg&mdash;I really do beg that you will take all the
      obnoxious boxes out of the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, auntie; but you'll come up to-morrow to see me in my dress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was Saturday, a holiday of course. Stephanotie had put her
      hair into Hinde's curlers the night before, and, in consequence, it was a
      perfect mass of frizzle and fluff the next morning. Miss Truefitt, who
      wore her own neat gray locks plainly banded round her head, gave a shudder
      when she first caught sight of Stephanotie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking, dear, during the night," she said, "of your pink silk
      dress, and I should very much prefer you to wear the gray cashmere trimmed
      with the neat velvet at the cuffs and collar. It would tone down your&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't say it," said Stephanotie; "my hair is a perfect glory this
      morning. Come yourself and look at it&mdash;here; stand just here; the sun
      is shining full on me. Everyone will have to look twice at me with a head
      like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, that is true," said Miss Truefitt; "and perhaps three times; and
      not approve of you then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come, auntie, you don't know how bewitching I look when I am got up
      in all my finery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is hopelessly vulgar," thought poor Miss Truefitt to herself; "and I
      always supposed Agnes would have such a nice, proper girl, such as she was
      herself in the old days; but that last photograph of Agnes shows a decided
      falling off. How truly glad I am that I was never induced to marry an
      American! I would rather have my neat, precise little house and a small
      income than go about like a figure of fun. That poor child will never be
      made English; it is a hopeless task. The sooner she goes back to America
      the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Stephanotie wandered about the house, thinking over and over of
      the happy moment when she would appear at The Laurels. She thought it best
      to put on her rose-colored dress in time for early dinner. It fitted her
      well, but was scarcely the best accompaniment to her fiery-red hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, lor', miss!" said Maria, the servant, when she first caught sight of
      Stephanotie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may well say, 'Oh, lor'!' Maria," replied Stephanotie, "although it
      is not a very pretty expression. But have a bon-bon; I don't mean to be
      cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      She whirled across the room, snatched hold of one of her boxes of
      bon-bons, and presented it to Maria. Maria was not averse to a chocolate
      peppermint, and popped one into her mouth. The next instant Miss Truefitt
      appeared. "Now, Stephanotie," she said, "do you think for a single moment&mdash;Oh,
      my dear child, you really are too awful! You don't mean to say you are
      going to The Laurels like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a bon-bon?" was Stephanotie's response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are downright rude. I will not allow you to offer me bon-bons again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a fresh box of them has just arrived. I got them by the eleven
      o'clock post to-day," was Stephanotie's reckless answer; "and, oh, such
      beauties! And I had a letter from mother to say that I might order as many
      as ever I liked from Fuller's. I mean to write to them to ask them to send
      me ten shillings' worth. I'll ask for the newest varieties. There surely
      must be bon-bons which would not give you indigestion, Aunt Vi."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must ask you to take off that dress, Stephanotie. I forbid you to go to
      The Laurels in such unsuitable attire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, lor'! and it's lovely!" said Maria, <i>sotto voce</i>, as she was
      leaving the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an unpleasant smell of peppermint!" said Miss Truefitt, sniffing at
      that moment. "You know, Stephanotie, how I have begged of you not to eat
      those unpleasant sweets in the dining room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't," said Stephanotie; "it was only Maria."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria backed out of the room with another violent "Oh, lor'!" and ran down
      to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have to give notice," she said. "It's Miss Stephanotie; she's the
      most dazzlingly brilliant young lady I ever set eyes on; but mistress will
      never forgive me for eating that peppermint in her presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rinse the mouth out, and take no notice," was the cook's somewhat
      heartless rejoinder. "How do you say she was dressed, Maria?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pink, the color of a rose, and that ravishing with lace. I never see'd
      such a dress," said Maria. "She's the most beautiful young lady and the
      queerest I ever set eyes on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanotie and her aunt were having a battle upstairs, and in the end the
      elder lady won. Stephanotie was obliged to take off the unsuitable dress
      and put on the gray cashmere. As subsequent events proved, it was lucky
      for her that she did do so.

      CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; LETTERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      By the post on the following morning there came two letters for Nora. She
      hailed them with a cry of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick was not in the room; she had a headache, and did not get up
      to breakfast. Terence had already started for town. He had secured the
      post he desired in his uncle's office, and thought himself a very great
      man of business. Linda did not count for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora flung herself into an easy-chair, and opened the first of her
      letters. It was from her mother. She was soon lost in its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR NORA [wrote Mrs. O'Shanaghgan]: Be prepared for very great,
      startling, and at the same time gratifying, news. Your dear Uncle George,
      who has been spending the last three weeks with us, has made an
      arrangement which lifts us, my dear daughter, out of all pecuniary
      embarrassments. I will tell you as briefly as possible what has taken
      place. He had a consultation with your father, and induced him, at my
      suggestion, to unburden his mind to him. You know the Squire's ways. He
      pooh-poohed the subject and fought shy of it; but at last I myself brought
      him to task, and the whole terrible and disgraceful state of things was
      revealed. My dear Nora, my dear little girl, we were, it appears, on the
      brink of bankruptcy. In a couple of months O'Shanaghgan would no longer
      have been ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot say that I should ever have regretted leaving this ramshackle and
      much-dilapidated place, but of course I should have shrunk from the
      disgrace, the exposure, the feeling that I was the cynosure of all eyes.
      That, indeed, would have cut me to the quick. Had your father consented to
      sell O'Shanaghgan and live in England, it would have been a moment of
      great rejoicing for me; but the place to be sold up over his head was
      quite a different matter. This, my dear Nora, seems to have been the
      position of affairs when your dear uncle, like a good providence or a
      guardian angel, appeared on the scene. Your uncle, my dearest Nora, is a
      very rich man. My dear brother has been careful with regard to money
      matters all his life, and is now in possession of a very large supply of
      this world's goods. Your dear uncle was good enough to come to the rescue,
      and has bought O'Shanaghgan from the man to whom your father owed the
      mortgage. O'Shanaghgan now belongs to your Uncle George."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" cried Nora, springing to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, Nora?" said Linda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk to me for the present, or I'll say something you won't like to
      hear," replied Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, I must say you are copying Molly in your manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't speak to me," said Nora. Her face was crimson; she had never felt
      such a wild, surging sense of passion in the whole of her existence.
      Linda's calm gray eyes were upon her, however. She managed to suppress any
      more emotion, saw that her cousin was burning with curiosity, and
      continued the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Although, my dearest Nora, Castle O'Shanaghgan now belongs to your Uncle
      George, don't suppose for a single moment that he is going to be unkind to
      us. Far from it. To all appearance the place is still ours; but with, oh!
      such a difference. Your father is still, in the eyes of the tenants and of
      the country round, the owner of Castle O'Shanaghgan; but, after consulting
      with me, your Uncle George felt that he must not have the reins. His Irish
      nature, my dear&mdash;But I need not discuss that. You know as well as I
      do how reckless and improvident he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother!" gasped Nora. She clenched her little white teeth, and had
      great difficulty in proceeding with her letter. Linda's curiosity,
      however, acted as a restorative, and she went on with her mother's lengthy
      epistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All things are now changed, and I may as well say that a glorious era has
      begun. Castle O'Shanaghgan is now your uncle's property, and it will soon
      be a place to be proud of. He is having it refurnished from attic to
      cellar; carpets, curtains, mirrors, furniture of all sorts have already
      begun to arrive from one of the most fashionable shops in Dublin.
      Gardeners have been got to put the gardens to rights, the weeds have been
      removed from the avenue, the grass has been cut, the lawns have been mown;
      the whole place looks already as if it had undergone a resurrection. My
      bedroom, dear Nora, is now a place suitable for your mother to sleep in;
      the bare boards are covered with a thick Brussels carpet. The Axminster
      stair carpets arrived yesterday. In the dining room is one of the most
      magnificent Turkey carpets I have ever seen; and your uncle has insisted
      on having the edge of the floor laid with parquetry. Will you believe me,
      Nora?&mdash;your father has objected to the sound of the hammering which
      the workmen make in putting in the different pieces of wood. You can
      scarcely believe it possible; but I state a fact. The stables are being
      filled with suitable horses; and with regard to that I am glad to say your
      father does take some interest. A victoria has arrived for me, and a
      pony-trap for you, dear; for it seems your Uncle George has taken a great
      fancy to you, my little Nora. Well, dear, all this resurrection, this
      wonderful restoration of Castle O'Shanaghgan has occurred during your
      absence. You will come back to a sort of fairyland; but it is one of your
      uncle's stipulations that you do not come back at present; and, of course,
      for such a fairy godfather, such a magician, no promise is too great to
      give. So I have told him, dear Nora, that you will live with your kind and
      noble Aunt Grace, and with your charming cousin Linda, and your cousin
      Molly&mdash;about whom I do not hear so much&mdash;as long as he wishes
      you to do so. You will receive the best of educations, and come back at
      Christmas to a suitable home. You must have patience until then. It is
      your uncle's proposal that at Christmas-time you and your cousins also
      come to O'Shanaghgan, and that we shall have a right good old-fashioned
      Christmas in this place, which at last is beautiful and worthy of your
      ancient house. You must submit patiently, therefore, dear Nora, to
      remaining in England. You will probably spend the greater portion of your
      time there for the next few years, until you are really accomplished. But
      the holidays you, with your dear cousins and your uncle and aunt, will
      always spend at O'Shanaghgan. You must understand, dear, that the house
      really belongs to your uncle; the place is his, and we are simply his
      tenants, from whom he nobly asks no rent. How proud I am of my dear
      brother, and how I rejoice in this glorious change!&mdash;Your
      affectionate mother,
    </p>
    <p>
      "ELLEN O'SHANAGHGAN.".
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter dropped from Nora's fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And was it I who effected all this?" she said to herself. "And I thought
      I was doing good."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other letter lay unopened on her lap. She took it up with trembling
      hands, and broke the seal. It was a short letter compared to her mother's,
      but it was in the handwriting she loved best on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "LIGHT O' THE MORNING [it began]: Why, then, my darling, it's done&mdash;it
      is all over. The place is mine no longer; it belongs to the English. To
      think I, O'Shanaghgan of Castle O'Shanaghgan, should live to write the
      words. Your mother put it to me, and I could not refuse her; but, oh, Nora
      asthore, heart of my life, I can scarcely bear to live here now. What with
      the carpets and the curtains, and the fuss and the misery, and the whole
      place being turned into a sort of furniture-shop, it is past bearing. I
      keep out most of my time in the woods, and I won't deny to you, my dearest
      child, that I have shed some bitter tears over the change in O'Shanaghgan;
      for the place isn't what it was, and it's heart-breaking to behold it. But
      your mother is pleased, and that's one comfort. I always did all I could
      for her; and when she smiles at me and looks like the sun&mdash;she is a
      remarkably handsome woman, Nora&mdash;I try to take a bit of comfort. But
      I stumble over the carpets and the mats, and your mother is always saying,
      'Patrick, take care where you are going, and don't let the dogs come in to
      spoil the new carpets.' And the English servants that we have now taken
      are past bearing; and it's just as if I were in chains, and I would almost
      as lief the place had been sold right away from me as see it in its
      changed condition. I can add no more now, my child, except to say that, as
      I am under great and bitter obligations to your Uncle George,
    </p>
    <p>
      I must agree to his request that you stay in England for the present; but
      Christmas is coming, and then I'll clasp you in my arms, and I'll have a
      grain of comfort again.&mdash;Your sorrowful old father,
    </p>
    <p>
      PATRICK O'SHANAGHGAN."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora's cheeks flushed brighter than ever as she read these two letters.
      The first had cut her to the heart; the second had caused that desire for
      weeping which unless it is yielded to amounts to torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! if Linda would not stay in the room. Oh! if she might crouch away
      where she, too, could shed tears over the changed Castle O'Shanaghgan. For
      what did she and her father want with a furniture-shop? Must she, for all
      the rest of her days, live in a sort of feather-bed house? Must the
      bareness, the space, the sense of expansion, be hers no more? She was half
      a savage, and her silken fetters were tortures to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will kill him," she murmured. She said the words aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will kill him? What is wrong? Do, please, tell me," said Linda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora looked at her with flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How bright your cheeks are, Nora, and how your eyes shine! But you look
      very, very angry. What can be the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Matter? There is plenty the matter. I cannot tell you now," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll go up and ask mother; perhaps she will tell me. It has
      something to do with that old place of yours, I have not the slightest
      doubt. Mother has got a very long letter from Ireland; she will tell me
      perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, go; and don't come back again," said Nora, almost rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She gets worse and worse," thought Linda as she slowly mounted the
      stairs. "Nora is anything but a pleasure in the house. At first when she
      came she was not quite so bad; she had a pretty face, and her manners had
      not been coarsened from contamination with Molly. Now she is much changed.
      Yes, I'll go to mother and talk to her. What an awful afternoon we are
      likely to have with that American girl here and Nora changing for the
      worse hour by hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda knocked at her mother's door. Mrs. Hartrick was not well, and was
      sitting up in bed reading her letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My head is better, Linda," she said. "I shall get up presently. What is
      it, darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is only the usual thing," said Linda, with a deep sigh. "I am always
      being rubbed the wrong way, and I don't like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it seems, my pet. But how nicely you have done your hair this morning!
      How very neat and ladylike you are becoming, Linda! You are a great
      comfort to me, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, mother; I try to please you," said Linda. She seated herself
      on her mother's bed, suppressed a sigh, then said eagerly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora is awfully put out. Is there bad news from that wild place, Castle
      O'Shanaghgan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad news?" cried Mrs. Hartrick. "Has the child had letters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, two; she had been reading them instead of eating her breakfast, and
      the sighs and the groans, and the flashing eyes and the clenched teeth,
      and the jumping to her feet and the flopping herself down again have been
      past bearing. She won't let out anything except that she is downright
      miserable, and that it is a burning shame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can she mean, mother? Is the old place sold? I always expected they
      were terribly poor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best, most splendid news," said Mrs. Hartrick. "My dear Linda, you
      must be mistaken. Your father says that he has given your aunt and uncle
      leave to tell Nora everything. I thought the child would be in the seventh
      heaven of bliss; in fact, I was almost dreading her arrival on the scene,
      she is so impetuous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, mother, she is not in any seventh heaven of bliss," replied Linda;
      "so perhaps they have not told her. But what is it, mother dear? Do tell
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is this, darling&mdash;your father has bought Castle O'Shanaghgan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! and given it to the O'Shanaghgans. Why did he do that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has bought it, but he has not given it to the O'Shanaghgans. Some day,
      if Terence turns out worthy, the old place will doubtless be his, as we
      have no son of our own; but at present it is your father's property; he
      has bought it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then no wonder poor Nora is sad," said Linda. "I can understand her; she
      is fond of the old place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should she be sad? They are not going; they are to stay there,
      practically owners of all they possess; for, although the property is
      really your father's, he will only exercise sufficient control to prevent
      that poor, wild, eccentric uncle of yours from throwing good money after
      bad. To all intents and purposes the O'Shanaghgans still hold possession;
      only now, my dear Linda, they will have a beautiful house, magnificently
      furnished. The grounds are carefully attended to, good gardeners provided,
      English servants sent for, and the whole place made suitable for your
      father's sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But does Nora know of this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so. I know your father said she was to be told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is very miserable about something. I cannot understand her," said
      Linda. "I tell you what, I'll just go down and tell her. Perhaps those two
      letters were nothing but grumbles; and the O'Shanaghgans did not know then
      the happiness that was in store for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can tell her if you like, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, I will," said Linda. She jumped off her mother's bed and ran
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora was standing in the conservatory. She was gazing straight before her,
      not at the great, tall, flowering cactus nor the orchids, nor the mass of
      geraniums and pelargoniums of every shade and hue&mdash;she was seeing a
      picture of a wild, wild lonely place, of a bare old house, of a seashore
      that was like no other seashore in the world. She was looking at this
      picture with all the heart of which she was capable shining in her eyes;
      and she knew that she was looking at it in imagination only, and that she
      would never see the real picture again, for the wild old place was wild no
      longer, and in Nora's opinion the glory had departed. She turned when
      Linda's somewhat mincing voice fell upon her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you startled me!" she said. "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, good news," said Linda. "I am not quite so bad as you think me, Nora,
      and I am delighted. Mother has told me everything. Castle O'Shanaghgan is
      yours to live in as long as ever you care to do so. Of course it belongs
      to us; but that does not matter, and it is furnished from attic to cellar
      most splendidly, and there are English servants, and there are&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything abominable and odious and horrible!" burst from Nora's lips.
      "Oh, don't keep me; don't keep me! I am smothered at the thought&mdash;O'Shanaghgan
      is ruined&mdash;ruined!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran away from her cousin out into the air. At headlong speed did she
      go, until at last she found herself in the most remote and least
      cultivated part of the plantation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, to be alone! Now she could cry, and cry she did right bitterly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; THE BOX OF BON-BONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It occurred to Stephanotie that, as she could not wear the rose-colored
      dress, as she must go perforce to the Hartricks' in her dove-colored
      cashmere, with its very neat velvet collar and cuffs, she would at least
      make her entrance a little striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not take a box of bon-bons to Mrs. Hartrick?" she said to herself.
      "There's that great big new box which I have not opened yet It contains
      dozens of every kind of sweetmeat. I'll present it to her; she'll be
      pleased with the attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      The box was a very large one; on its lid was painted a picture of two or
      three cupids hovering in the air, some of them touching the shoulders of a
      pretty girl who was supposed to be opening a box of chocolates. There was
      a good deal of color and embossed writing also on the cover, and
      altogether it was as showy and, in Stephanotie's opinion, as handsome a
      thing as anybody could desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked through the village, holding the box, tied with great bunches
      of red ribbon, in her hand. She scorned to put a brown-paper cover over
      it; she would take it in all its naked glory into the midst of the
      Hartrick household.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her way she met the other two girls who were also going to spend an
      afternoon at The Laurels. Rose and Mabel Armitage were the daughters of a
      neighbouring squire. They were nice girls, but conventional.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing original about either of them; but they were very much
      respected in the school, not only on account of their father's position&mdash;he
      represented the county in the House&mdash;but also because they were good,
      industrious, and so-called clever. The Armitages took prizes at every
      examination. Their French was considered very nearly Parisian in accent;
      their drawings were all in absolutely perfect proportions. It is true the
      trees in Rose's landscapes looked a little stiff; but how carefully she
      laid on her water-colors; how honestly she endeavored to copy her master's
      smallest requirements! Then Mabel played with great correctness, never for
      a single moment allowing a wrong note to appear; and they both sang, very
      prettily, simple little ballads; and they were dressed with exquisite
      neatness and propriety in very quiet colors&mdash;dark blues, very dark
      reds, pretty, neat blouses, suitable skirts. Their hair was shiny, and sat
      in little tight tendrils and pretty curls round their heads. They were as
      like as two peas&mdash;each girl had a prim little mouth with rosy lips;
      each girl possessed an immaculate set of white teeth; each girl had a
      little, straight nose and pretty, clear gray-blue eyes; their foreheads
      were low, their eyebrows penciled and delicately marked. They had neat
      little figures; they were neat in every way, neat in soul too; admirable
      little people, but commonplace. And, just because they were commonplace,
      they did not like fiery-red-haired Stephanotie; they thought Molly the
      essence of vulgarity; they secretly admired beautiful Nora, but thought
      her manners and style of conversation deplorable; and they adored Linda as
      a kindred spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing them walking on in advance, like a little pair of doves,
      Stephanotie quickened her steps until she came up to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!" she said; "you guess where I'm off to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure I cannot say," answered Rose, turning gently round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mabel was always Rose's echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say," she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can guess where you're going. You're going to have a right down
      good time at The Laurels&mdash;guess I'm right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are going to spend an afternoon at The Laurels," said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An afternoon at The Laurels," echoed Mabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so am I&mdash;that's the best of the fun," said Stephanotie; "and I
      mean to give her something to remember me by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom do you mean?" said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my good, respected hostess, Mrs. Hartrick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean to give her?" asked Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This. How do you like it? It's full of bon-bons."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, notwithstanding her virtuous and commonplace mind, had a secret
      leaning toward bon-bons. She did not dare to confess it even to Mabel; for
      Mabel also had a secret leaning, and did not dare to confess it to Rose.
      It was not <i>comme il faut</i> in their family for the girls of the house
      to indulge in bon-bons; but still, they would have liked some of those
      delicious sweets, and had often envied Stephanotie when she was showing
      them to her companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, not for worlds would they have been friendly with the terrible
      American girl; but they did envy her her boxes of sweets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How gay!" said Rose, looking at the startling cover, with its cupids and
      its greedy-looking maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How jolly," said the American girl&mdash;"how luscious when you're eating
      them! Would you like to see them inside?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I think not," said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better not," said Mabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why better not?" continued Stephanotie. "It's natural that girls like
      us should like sweetmeats, bon-bons, or anything of that sort. Here,
      there's a nice little bit of shelter under this tree, and there's no one
      looking. I'll untie the ribbons; just hold the box, Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose held it. Stephanotie hastily pulled off the red ribbons and lifted
      the cover. Oh, how delicious the inside did look!&mdash;rows upon rows of
      every imaginable sweet&mdash;cream-colored sweets, rose-colored, green,
      white; plums, apples, pears, figs, chocolates; every sort that the heart
      of girl could desire lay before them in rows on rows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are, every one of them, for Mrs. Hartrick," said Stephanotie, "and
      you mustn't touch them. But I have got two boxes in my pocket; they make
      it bulge out; I should be glad to get rid of them. We'll tie this up, but
      you'll each have one of my boxes."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a jiffy the big box was tied up again with its huge crimson bows, and
      each of the Armitage girls possessed one of the American girl's boxes of
      bon-bons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't they pretty? Do have some; you don't know how long you may be kept
      waiting for your tea," said Stephanotie as she danced beside her
      companions up the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this fashion, therefore, did the three enter the house, for both of the
      Armitages had yielded to temptation, and each girl was just finishing a
      large bon-bon when they appeared on the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick was standing in the great square central hall, waiting for
      her guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanotie ran up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very good of you indeed to ask me," she said; "and please accept
      this&mdash;won't you? It's from an American girl, a trophy to remember her
      by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed?" said Mrs. Hartrick, flushing very brightly. She stepped back a
      little; the huge box of bon-bons was forced into her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jehoshaphat!" exclaimed Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly!" said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda uttered a little sigh. Rose and Mabel immediately became as discreet
      and commonplace and proper as they could be; but Stephanotie knew that the
      boxes of bon-bons were reposing in each of their pockets and her spirits
      rose higher than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Irish Nora?" she said. "It's she that is fond of a good sweet
      such as they make for us in the States. But have the box&mdash;won't you,
      Mrs. Hartrick? I have brought it to you as a token of my regard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed? Thank you very much, Miss Miller," said Mrs. Hartrick in a chilly
      voice. She laid the box on a side-table.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; THE TELEGRAM,
    </h2>
    <p>
      The girls went out into the grounds. The afternoon happened to be a
      perfect one; the air was balmy, with a touch of the Indian summer about
      it. The last roses were blooming on their respective bushes; the geraniums
      were making a good show in the carefully laid out beds. There were clumps
      of asters and dahlias to be seen in every direction; some late poppies and
      some sweet-peas and mignonette made the borders still look very
      attractive, and the chrysanthemums were beginning to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a week's time they will be splendid," said Linda, piloting her two
      friends through the largest of the greenhouses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do come away," said Molly; "when Linda speaks in that prim voice she's
      intolerable. Come, Nora; come, Stephie&mdash;we'll just have a run by
      ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora was still looking rather pale. The shock of the morning had caused
      the color to fade from her cheeks; she could not get the utterly changed
      O'Shanaghgan out of her head. She longed to write to her father, and yet
      she did not dare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanotie looked at her with the curious, keen glance which an American
      girl possesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it? Do say," she said, linking her hand inside Nora's. "Is it
      anything that a bon-bon will soothe, or is it past that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite past that; but don't ask me now, Stephie. I cannot tell you,
      really."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't bother her," said Molly; "she has partly confided in me, but not
      wholly. We'll have a good time by ourselves. What game do you think we had
      best play, Stephie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not one for games at all," answered Stephanotie. "Girls of my age
      don't play games. They are thinking seriously of the business of life&mdash;the
      flirtations and the jolly time they are going to have before they settle
      down to their staid married life. You English are so very childish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we Irish are childish too," said Nora. "It's lovely to be childish,"
      she added. "I hate to put away childish things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear! so that is the Irish and English way," said Stephanotie. "But
      there, don't let us talk nationalities; let's be cozy and cheerful. I can
      tell you I did feel annoyed at coming here such a dowd; it was not my
      fault. I meant to make an impression; I did, really and truly. It was very
      good of you, Molly, to ask me; and I know that proud lady, your mother,
      didn't want to have me a bit. I am nothing but Stephanotie Miller, and she
      doesn't know the style we live in at home. If she did, maybe she would
      open her eyes a little; but she doesn't, and that's flat; and I am vulgar,
      or supposed to be, just because I am frank and open, and I have no
      concealment about me. I call a spade a spade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hurrah! so do I," said Molly, the irrepressible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, I don't use your words; they wouldn't suit me at all,"
      said the American girl. "I never call out Jehoshaphat the way you do,
      whoever Jehoshaphat <i>is</i>; but I have my little eccentricities, and
      they run to pretty and gay dresses&mdash;dresses with bright colors and
      quantities of lace on them&mdash;and bon-bons at all hours, in season and
      out of season. It's easy to content me, and I don't see why my little
      innocent wishes should not be gratified."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are very nicely dressed now," said Nora, looking with approval at
      the gray cashmere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me nicely dressed!" screamed Stephanotie. "Do you call this dress nice?
      Why, I do declare it's a perfect shame that I should be made such a
      spectacle. It don't suit my hair. When I am ordering a dress I choose
      shades of red; they tone me down. I am fiery to-day&mdash;am I not,
      Molly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you certainly are," said Molly. "But what&mdash;what did you do to
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To my locks, do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. They do stick out so funnily. I know mother was shocked; she likes
      our heads to be perfectly smooth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like the Armitages', for instance," said Stephanotie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes; something like theirs. They are pretty girls, are they not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Stephanotie; "but don't they give you the quivers? Don't you
      feel as if you were rubbed the wrong way the moment you speak to them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't take to them," said Molly; "but I think they're pretty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're just like what O'Shanaghgan is now," thought Nora, who did not
      speak. "They are all prim and proper; there's not a single wildness
      allowed to come out anywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they're for all the world like anybody else," said Stephanotie.
      "Don't they love sweeties just! If you' had seen them&mdash;the greedy way
      they took the bon-bons out of the little boxes I gave them. Oh, they're
      just like anybody else, only they are playing parts; they are little
      actors; they're always acting. I'd like to catch them when they were not.
      I'd like to have them for one wild week, with you, Molly, and you, Nora. I
      tell you there would be a fine change in them both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a telegraph-boy coming down the avenue," cried Molly suddenly.
      "I'll run and see what is the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora did not know why her heart beat. Telegrams arrived every day at The
      Laurels. Nevertheless she felt sure that this was no ordinary message; she
      stood now and stared at that boy as though her eyes would start from their
      sockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter?" said Stephanotie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing&mdash;nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're vexed about something. Why should you be so distant with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not, Stephie. I am a little anxious; it is difficult always to be
      just the same," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't I know it, my darling; and if you had as much to do with Aunt
      Vi Truefitt as I have, you would realize how often <i>my</i> spirits turn
      topsy-turvy. I often hope that I'll be Englishized quickly, so that I may
      get back to my dear parents. But there, Molly is coming back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The telegram was for mother," she said. "Do let us play."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora looked at Molly. Her face was red; it was usually pale. Nora wondered
      what had brought that high color into her cheeks. Molly seemed excited,
      and did not want to meet her cousin's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, let us have a race," she said. "I don't want to put away childish
      things. I want to have a good game while I am in the humor. Let us see who
      will get first to the top of that hill. I like running uphill. I'm off;
      catch me who may!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly started. Her figure was stout, and she ran in a somewhat awkward
      way. Nora flew after her. She soon reached her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, stop running," she said. "What is up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is up?" echoed Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; what was in that telegram?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The telegram was for mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you know what was in it. I know you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing&mdash;nothing, Nora. Come, our race isn't over yet. I'm off
      again; you cannot catch me this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly ran, panting as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell her; I won't," she said to herself. "I wish her eyes were
      not so sharp. She is sure to find out; but I have begged and prayed of
      mother not to tell her, at least until after Stephanotie and the others
      have gone. Then, I suppose, she must know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly reached the top of the hill. She was so blown that she had to fling
      herself on the grass. Nora again reached her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, Molly," she said; "there is something the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a telegram for mother, and I cannot tell you anything whatever
      about it," said Molly in a cross voice. "There, I'm off once more. I
      promised Linda that I would help her to look after the Armitage girls.
      Prim and proper as they are, they are sometimes a little bit too much for
      my dainty sister Linda. You take care of Stephie; she's right good fun.
      Let me go, Nora; let me go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly pulled her hand almost roughly out of her cousin's grip, and the
      next moment was rushing downhill as fast as she could in the direction of
      the summer-house. There she knew she would find Linda and her two friends.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; THE BLOW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all the efforts of at least five merry girls, there was a
      cloud over the remainder of that afternoon. Nora's face was anxious; her
      gay laugh was wanting; her eyes wore an abstracted, far-away look. The
      depression which the letters of the morning had caused was now increased
      tenfold. If she joined in the games it was without spirit; when she spoke
      there was no animation in her words. Gone was the Irish wit, the pleasant
      Irish humor; the sparkle in the eyes was missing; the gay laughter never
      rose upon the breeze. At tea things were just as bad. Even at supper
      matters had not mended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly now persistently avoided her cousin. Stephanotie and she were having
      a wild time. Molly, to cover Nora's gloom, was going on in a more
      extravagant way than usual. She constantly asked Jehoshaphat to come to
      her aid; she talked of Holy Moses more than once; in short, she exceeded
      herself in her wildness. Linda was so shocked that she took the Armitage
      girls to a distant corner, and there discoursed with them in low whispers.
      Now and then she cast a horrified glance round at where her sister and the
      Yankee, as she termed Stephanotie, were going on together. To her relief,
      toward the end of the evening, Mrs. Hartrick came into the room. But even
      her presence could not suppress Molly now. She was beside herself; the
      look of Nora sitting gloomily apart from the rest, pretending to be
      interested in one of Sir Walter Scott's novels, was too much for her. She
      knew that a bad time was coming for Nora, and her misery made her
      reckless. Mrs. Hartrick, hearing some of her naughtiest words, said in an
      icy tone that Miss Truefitt had sent a maid for Stephanotie; and a few
      moments afterward the little party broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the strange girls had departed, Mrs. Hartrick turned
      immediately to Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am shocked at your conduct," she said. "In order to give you pleasure I
      allowed Miss Miller to come here; but I should have been a wiser and
      happier woman if I had taken dear Linda's advice. She is not the sort of
      girl I wish either you or Nora ever to associate with again. Now, go
      straight to your room, and don't leave it until I send for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly stalked off with a defiant tread and eyes flashing fire; she would
      not even glance at Nora. Linda began to talk in her prim voice. Before she
      could utter a single word Nora had sprung forward, caught both her aunt's
      hands, and looked her in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," she said, "I must know. What did that telegram say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What telegram, Nora? My dear child, you forget yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not forget myself, Aunt Grace. If I am not to go quite off my head,
      I must know the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot sit; please put me out of suspense. Please tell me the worst at
      once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry for you, dear; I really am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please, please speak! Is anything&mdash;anything wrong with father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope nothing serious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I knew it," said Nora; "there is something wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has had an accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An accident? An accident? Oh, what? Oh! it's Andy; it must be Andy. Oh,
      Aunt Grace, I shall go mad; I shall go mad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick did not speak. Then she looked at Linda. She motioned to
      Linda to leave the room. Linda, however, had no idea of stirring. She was
      too much interested; she looked at Nora as if she thought her really mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me&mdash;tell me; is father killed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, my poor child; no, no. Do calm yourself, Nora. I will let you see
      the telegram; then you will know all that I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please, please!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick took it out of her pocket. Nora clutched it very hard, but
      her trembling fingers could scarcely take the little flimsy pink sheet out
      of its envelope. At last she had managed it. She spread it before her;
      then she found that her dazed eyes could not see the words. What was the
      misery of the morning to the agony of this moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read it for me," she said in a piteous voice. "I&mdash;I cannot see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, my dear; you will faint if you don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! everything is going round. Is he&mdash;is he dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dear; nothing very wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read&mdash;read!" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick did read. The following words fell upon the Irish girl's
      ears:
    </p>
    <p>
      "O'Shanaghgan was shot at from behind a hedge this, morning. Seriously
      injured. Break it to Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must go to him," said Nora, jumping up. "When is the next train? Why
      didn't you tell me before? I must go&mdash;I must go at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the worst of the news was broken, she had recovered her courage
      and some calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must go to him," she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have telegraphed. I have been mindful of you. I knew the moment you
      heard this news you would wish to be off to Ireland, so I have telegraphed
      to know if there is danger. If there is danger you shall go, my dear
      child; indeed, I myself will take you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I must go in any case," repeated Nora. "Danger or no danger, he is
      hurt, and he will want me. I must go; you cannot keep me here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then there came a loud ring at the hall-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubtless that is the telegram," said Mrs. Hartrick. "Run, Linda, and
      bring it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda raced into the hall. In a few moments she came back with a telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The messenger is waiting, mother," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick tore it open, read the contents, uttered a sigh of relief,
      and then handed the paper on to Nora to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," she said; "you can read for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora read:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better. Doctor anticipates no danger. Tell Nora I do not wish her to
      come. Writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "HARTRICK."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, my dear, this is a great relief," said Mrs. Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I am going all the same," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; that I cannot possibly allow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he wants me, even if he is not in danger. It was bad enough to be
      away from him when he was well; but now that he is ill&mdash;&mdash;You
      don't understand, Aunt Grace&mdash;there is no one can do anything for
      father as I can. I am his Light o' the Morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His what?" said Mrs. Hartrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that is what he calls me; but I have no time to explain now. I must
      go; I don't care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are an ungrateful girl, Nora. If you had lived through the misery I
      have lived through the last few hours this telegram would fill you with
      thankfulness. It is your duty to stay here. You are under a promise to
      your kind uncle. He has rescued your father and mother from a most
      terrible position, and your promise to him saying that you would stay
      quietly here you cannot in all honor break. If your father were in danger
      it would be a different matter. As it is, it is your duty to stay quietly
      here, and show by your patience how truly you love him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora sat silent. Mrs. Hartrick's words were absolute. The good lady felt
      that she was strictly following the path of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can understand the shock you have had," she continued, looking at the
      girl, who now sat with her head slightly drooping, her hands clasped
      tightly together, her attitude one of absolute despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Linda," she said, turning to her daughter, "fetch Nora a glass of wine. I
      noticed, my dear, that you ate scarcely any supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda returned with a glass of claret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now drink this off, Nora," said her aunt; "I insist."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora was about to refuse, but she suddenly changed her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall go whether she gives me leave or not," was her inward thought. "I
      shall want strength." She drank off the wine, and returned the empty glass
      to her cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There now, that is better," said Mrs. Hartrick; "and as you are
      unaccustomed to wine you will doubtless sleep soundly after it. Go up to
      your bedroom, dear. I will telegraph the first thing in the morning to
      O'Shanaghgan, and if there is the slightest cause for alarm will promise
      to take you there immediately. Be content with my promise; be patient, be
      brave, I beg of you, Nora. But, believe me, your uncle knows best when he
      says you are not to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Aunt Grace," said Nora in a low voice. She did not glance at
      Linda. She turned and left the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; TEN POUNDS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Molly was standing by the open window of her room when Nora came in. She
      entered quite quietly. Every vestige of color had left her face; her eyes,
      dark and intensely blue, were shining; some of her jet-black hair had got
      loosened and fell about her neck and shoulders. Molly sprang toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Nora!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said Nora. "I have heard; father is hurt&mdash;very badly hurt,
      and I am going to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you indeed? Is mother going to take you?" said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; she has refused. A telegram has come from my uncle; he says I am not
      to go&mdash;as if a thousand telegrams would keep me. Molly, I am going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you cannot go alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When?" said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now&mdash;this very minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What nonsense! There are no trains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall leave the house and stay at the station. I shall take the very
      next train to town. I am going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Nora, have you money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money?" said Nora. "I never thought of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother won't give you money if she does not wish you to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go to my room and see." Nora rushed away. She came back in a few
      moments with her purse; she flung the contents on Molly's bed. Molly took
      up the silver coins as they rattled out of Nora's purse. Alack and alas!
      all she possessed was eight shillings and a few coppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot go with that," said Molly; "and I have nothing to lend you, or
      I would; indeed, I would give you all I possess, but mother only gives me
      sixpence a week. Nothing would induce her to give me an allowance. I have
      sixpence a week just as if I were a baby, and you can quite understand I
      don't save out of that. What is to be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora looked nonplused. For the first time the vigorous intention, the
      fierce resolve which was bearing her onward, was checked, and checked by
      so mighty a reason that she could not quite see her way out of the present
      difficulty. To ask her Aunt Grace for money would be worse than useless.
      Nora was a sufficient reader of character to be quite certain that Mrs.
      Hartrick when she said a thing meant it. She would be kind to Nora up to a
      certain point. Were her father in what they called danger she herself
      would be the first to help Nora to go to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How little they know how badly he wants me!" thought the girl; "how all
      this time he is pining for me&mdash;he who never knew illness in his life&mdash;pining,
      pining for me! Nothing shall keep me from him. I would steal to go to him;
      there is nothing I would not do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora, how queer you look!" said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am thinking," said Nora. "I wonder how I am to get that money? Oh, I
      have it. I'll ask Stephanotie to lend it to me. Do you think she would?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I think it very likely. She is generous, and she has heaps
      of money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll go to her," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, Nora; if you really want to run away&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run away?" said Nora. "If you like to call it so, you may; but I'm going.
      My own father is ill; my uncle and aunt don't hold the same position to me
      that my father holds. I will go to him&mdash;I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I tell you what it is," said Molly, "you must do this thing
      carefully or you'll be locked up in your bedroom. Mother would think
      nothing of locking the door of your bedroom and keeping you there. You
      don't know mother when once her back is up. She can be immensely kind up
      to a certain point, and then&mdash;oh! I know it&mdash;immensely cruel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be done?" said Nora. "I hate doing a thing in this kind of way&mdash;in
      the dark, as it were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must listen to me," said Molly; "you must be very careful. I have had
      some little scampers in my time, and I know how to manage matters. There
      is only one way for you to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and I must go off and see Stephanotie; but we cannot do so until
      everyone is in bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can we go then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can easily climb down from this window. You see this pear-tree; it
      almost touches the window. I have climbed down by it more than once; we
      can get in again the same way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. If we must sneak out of the house like thieves," said Nora,
      "it's as good as any other way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you it's the only way," said Molly. "We must be off on our way to
      London before mother gets up tomorrow morning. You don't know anything
      whatever about trains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can look them out," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go back to your room. Mother will not be going to bed for quite an
      hour. We cannot help it; we can do nothing until she is safe in bed. Go
      away at once, Nora; for if she finds you here talking to me she will
      suspect something. I cannot tell you what mother is when once her
      suspicions are aroused; and she has had good cause to suspect me before
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But do you really mean to say you'll come with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly mean to say I won't let you go alone. Now then, go away; just
      pack a few things, and slip back to me when I knock on the wall. I know
      when mother has gone to bed; it is necessary that she should be asleep,
      and that Linda should be asleep also; that is all we require. Leave the
      rest to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are certain Stephanotie can lend us the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can but ask her. If she refuses we must only come back again and make
      the best of things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will never come back," said Nora. "I will go to the first pawnbroker's
      and pawn everything of value I possess; but go to my father I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admire your courage," said Molly. "Now then, go back to your room and
      wait for my signal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora returned to her room. She began to open and shut her drawers. She did
      not care about being quiet. It seemed to her that no one could keep her
      from her father against her will. She did not recognize the all-potent
      fact that she had no money herself for the journey. Still, the money must
      be obtained. Of course Stephanotie had it, and of course Stephanotie would
      lend it; it would only be a loan for a few days. When once Nora got to
      Ireland she would return the money immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her drawers and filled a little black bag which she had brought
      with her from home. She put in the trifles she might need on her journey;
      the rest of her things could stay; she could not be bothered with them one
      way or the other. Then she sat quite still on the edge of her bed. How
      earnestly she wished that her aunt would retire for the night, that Linda
      would be quiet! Linda's room adjoined Nora's&mdash;it opened into Nora's&mdash;and
      Linda, when occasions roused her suspicions, could be intensely watchful.
      She did not seem to be going to bed; she kept moving about in her room.
      Poor Nora could scarcely restrain herself from calling out, "Oh, do be
      quick, Linda! What are you staying up for?" but she refrained from saying
      the fatal words. Presently she heard the creak of Linda's bed as she got
      into it. This was followed by silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora breathed a sigh of relief, but still the dangers were not past. Her
      little black bag lay quite ready on the chair, and she herself sat on the
      edge of her bed. Mrs. Hartrick's steps were heard coming up the stairs,
      and the next moment the door of Nora's room was opened and the good lady
      looked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in bed, Nora," she said; "but this is very wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I could not sleep," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick went up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my dear child," she said, "I cannot rest until I see you safe in
      bed. Come, I must undress you myself. What a wan little face! My dear
      girl, you must trust in God. Your uncle's telegram assures us that there
      is no danger; and if there is the smallest occasion I will take you myself
      to your father tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! if you would only promise to take me," said poor Nora, suddenly
      rising to her feet, twining her arms round her aunt's neck, and looking
      full into her face. "Oh! don't say you will take me to my father if there
      is danger; say you'll take me in any case. It would break my heart to stay
      away. I cannot&mdash;cannot stay away from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you are talking in an unreasonable way, Nora&mdash;in a way I cannot
      for a moment listen to. Your uncle wishes you to stay where you are. He
      would not wish that if there was the least occasion for you to go to
      Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will not take me tomorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not unless your father is worse. Come, I must help you to get your things
      off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora felt herself powerless in Mrs. Hartrick's hands. The good lady
      quickly began to divest her of her clothes, soon her night-dress was
      popped on, and she was lying down in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that black bag doing here?" said Mrs. Hartrick, glancing at the
      bag as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was packing my things together to go to father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, dear, we must only trust there will be no necessity. Now,
      goodnight. Sleep well, my little girl. Believe me, I am not so
      unsympathetic as I look."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora made no reply. She covered her face with the bedclothes; a sob came
      from her throat. Mrs. Hartrick hesitated for a moment whether she would
      say anything further; but then, hoping that the tired-out girl would
      sleep, she went gently from the room. In the passage she thought for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did Nora pack that little bag?" she said to herself. "Can it be
      possible&mdash;but no, the child would not do it. Besides, she has no
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartrick entered her own room at the other end of the corridor and
      shut the door. Then stillness reigned over the house&mdash;stillness
      absolute and complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      No light had been burning under Molly's door when Mrs. Hartrick had
      passed. Molly, indeed, wiser than Nora, had got into bed and lay there,
      dressed, it is true, but absolutely in the dark. Nora also lay in her bed;
      every nerve was beating frantically; her body seemed to be all one great
      pulse. At last, in desperation, she sprang out of bed&mdash;there came the
      welcome signal from Molly's room. Nora struck a light and began to dress
      feverishly. In ten minutes she was once more in her clothes. She now put
      on the dark-gray traveling dress she had worn when coming to The Laurels.
      Her hat and jacket were quickly put on, and, carrying the little black
      bag, she entered Molly's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What hour is it?" said Nora. "It must be long past midnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no; nothing of the kind. It is not more than eleven o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I thought it was one or two. Do you know that your mother came to see
      me and insisted on my getting into bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were a great goose, Nora. You should have lain down as I did, in your
      clothes; that would have saved a little time. But come, mother has been
      quite quiet for half an hour and more; she must be sound asleep. We had
      better go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we had better go," said Nora. "I packed a few things in this bag; it
      is quite light, and I can carry it. My money is in it, too&mdash;eight
      shillings and fivepence. I do trust Stephanotie will be able to lend us
      the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly had not been idle while Nora was in her room. She had taken care to
      oil the hasp of the window; and now, with extreme caution, she lifted it
      up, taking care that it did not make the slightest sound as she did so.
      The next moment both girls were seated on the window-ledge. Molly sprang
      on to the pear-tree, which creaked and crackled under her weight; but Mrs.
      Hartrick was already in the land of dreams. Molly dropped on to the ground
      beneath, and then it was Nora's turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I shut the window before I get on to the pear-tree?" whispered
      Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; leave it open. Come just as you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora reached out her arms, grasped the pear tree, and slipped down to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then, we must be off," said Molly. "I hope Pilot won't bark." She was
      alluding to the big watchdog. "But there, I'll speak to him; he is very
      fond of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls stole across the grass. The dew lay heavy on it; their footsteps
      made no sound. Presently they reached the front of the house, and Pilot,
      with a deep bay, flew to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pilot! Pilot! quiet; good dog!" said Molly. She went on her knees, flung
      her arms round the dog, and began to whisper in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He understands," she said, looking up at Nora. The great creature seemed
      to do so; he wagged his feathery tail from side to side and accompanied
      the girls as far as the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, go home, go home," said Molly. She then took Nora's hand, and they
      ran down the road in the direction of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were not that you are so miserable I should enjoy this awfully,"
      said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how do you mean to wake Stephie?" asked Nora at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, luckily for us, her aunt, Miss Truefitt, is rather deaf. Miss
      Truefitt has a bedroom at the back of the house, and Stephanotie sleeps in
      front. I shall fling gravel at the window. There is not a soul, as you
      see, in the streets. It's well that it is such a quiet place; it will
      serve our purpose all the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      They now found themselves outside Miss Truefitt's house. Molly took up a
      handful of gravel and flung it in a great shower at Stephanotie's window.
      Both girls then waited eagerly for a response. At first there was none;
      once again Molly threw the gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do hope she will wake soon," she said, turning to Nora; "that gravel
      makes a great noise, and some of the neighbors may pop out their heads to
      see what is the matter. There! I saw a flicker of light in the room. She
      is thinking it is thieves; she won't for a single moment imagine that we
      are here. I do hope Miss Truefitt won't awaken; it will be all up with us
      if she does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, it won't," said Nora; "there's not a person in this place I could
      not get to help me in a cause like this. The one who is absolutely
      invulnerable, who cannot be moved, because she imagines herself to be
      right, is your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Stephie at the window now," said Molly. A little figure in a
      night-dress was seen peeping out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's us, Stephie. Let us in; it's most awfully important," whispered
      Molly's voice in deep sepulchral tones from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But say, what's the matter?" called Stephanotie, opening her window and
      popping out her curly head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't talk to you in the street. Slip down and open the hall-door and
      let us in," said Molly. "It's most vital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's life or death," whispered Nora. There was something in Nora's
      tremulous tones which touched Stephanotie, and at the same time stimulated
      her curiosity to such an extent that she flew into her clothes, dashing
      about perfectly reckless of the fact that she was making a loud noise;
      but, luckily for her, Miss Truefitt was deaf and the servants slept in a
      remote part of the old house. Soon Stephanotie was tumbling downstairs,
      the chain was taken off the door, and the two girls were admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where shall I take you?" said Stephanotie. "It's all as dark as pitch.
      You know Aunt Vi won't hear of gas in the house. But stay, we can go into
      the dining room. I suppose you can tell me by the light of a solitary
      glim." As she spoke she pointed to the candle which she was holding high
      above her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, or with no light at all," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanotie now opened the door of the dining room, and the three girls
      entered. Stephanotie placed the candle on the table and turned and faced
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she said, "what's up? What do you want me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to lend me all the money you have," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the money I have&mdash;good gracious!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jehoshaphat! be quick about it," said Molly. "We cannot stand here
      talking; we want to catch the very next train to town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should I lend you all the money I have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'll tell her, Nora; don't you speak," said Molly. "Nora's father has
      been awfully hurt; he was shot at from behind a hedge by some scoundrel in
      Ireland. A telegram came to-day about him to mother, and mother won't take
      Nora to Ireland unless her father is in danger, and Nora is determined to
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess I'd about do the same," said Stephanotie, nodding her head. "If
      poppa was shot at from behind a hedge, I guess there's nothing would keep
      me away from him. But is it for that you want the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Nora, plunging her hands into the depths of her black bag;
      "there's only eight shillings and five-pence here, and I can't get to
      Ireland with that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haul out the spoil," said Molly; "make no bones about it. I'm going with
      Nora, because the child isn't fit to travel alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You coming with me?" said Nora. "I didn't know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean to leave you, my dear, until I see you safe in the midst of
      your family; besides, I have a bit of curiosity with regard to that
      wonderful old place of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's lost, the place is quite lost," said Nora, remembering for the
      first time since the blow had fallen the feather-bed condition of Castle
      O'Shanaghgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, lost or found, I'd like to have a peep at it," said Molly; "so fork
      out the spoil, Stephie, and be quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, of course," said Stephanotie. "But how much do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All you possess, my dear; you cannot give us more than all you possess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when am I likely to have it back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, as if that mattered," said Molly; "the thing is to get Nora home. You
      won't be any the worse for this, if that is what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am not really thinking of that; but my school fees have to be paid,
      and the money only came from America two days ago for the purpose. You
      know Aunt Vi is very poor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor or rich, don't keep us waiting now," said Molly. "Look at Nora. Do
      you think for a single moment that your school bills matter when her heart
      is breaking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you shall have the money back, Stephie, every farthing, if I die to
      get it for you," said Nora with sudden passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't doubt you, darling," said the generous-hearted American girl.
      "Well, I'll go up to my room and see what I can do." She left the room,
      ran upstairs, and quickly returned with a fat purse. It contained gold and
      notes; and very soon Molly found, to her infinite delight, that it would
      be by no means necessary for her and Nora to take all Stephie's wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten pounds will be sufficient," said Molly. "I have not the slightest
      idea what the fares to Ireland are, but I have no doubt we shall do nicely
      with this sum. May we have these two five-pounds notes, Stephie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may and welcome," said Stephanotie. "I have nearly thirty pounds
      here; but it's on account of the school bills. As a rule, poppa is not
      quite so generous. He says it is better for young girls like me not to
      have too much money. I guess I'd eat too many bon-bons if I had a lot of
      money at my disposal. But had you not better take it in gold? It is much
      easier to change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure," said Molly. "Holy Moses! it's you that have got the sense,
      Stephie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for the compliment," replied Stephanotie. "Well, then, here you
      are&mdash;ten sovereigns. Good luck to you both. What do you mean to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to the station and find out about the trains, and start the very first
      moment possible," said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do wish I was going with you. It would be no end of a lark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you come?" asked Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I might; but there, I suppose I had better not. I must look
      perfectly innocent to-morrow, or I may get into an awful scrape for this.
      You must both go now, or Aunt Vi when she turns in her sleep may wake. She
      turns in her sleep about three times during the night; and whenever she
      turns she wakes, so she tells me. I guess it's about time for her first
      turn now, so the sooner you are off the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you, Stephie! I shall never, never forget your kindness," said
      Nora. She flung her arms impulsively round Stephanotie's neck, and the
      next moment the girls left the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. &mdash; ADVENTURES&mdash;AND HOME AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The girls now went straight to the railway station; the hour was a quarter
      to twelve. They entered and asked at once if there was a train up to town.
      Yes; the last train would be due in ten minutes. Molly now took the
      management of affairs; she purchased a third-class ticket for herself and
      another for Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we go third-class we shall not be specially remarked," she said.
      "People always notice girls who travel first-class."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tickets being bought, the girls stood side by side on the platform.
      Molly had put on her shabbiest hat and oldest jacket; her gloves had some
      holes in them; her umbrella was rolled up in such a thick, ungainly
      fashion that it looked like a gamp. Nora, however, exquisitely neat and
      trim, stood by her companion's side, betraying as she did so traces of her
      good birth and breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must untidy yourself a bit when we get into the train," said Molly.
      "I'll manage it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, never mind about my looks; the thing is to get off," said Nora. "I'm
      not a scrap afraid," she added; "if Aunt Grace came to me now she could
      not induce me to turn back; nothing but force would make me. I have got
      the money, and to Ireland I will go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admire you for your determination," said Molly. "I never knew that an
      Irish girl could have so much spunk in her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not? Aren't we about the finest race on God's earth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come, come," said Molly; "you mustn't overdo it. Even you sometimes
      carry things a trifle too far."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the train came in. There was the usual bustle of passengers
      alighting and others getting in; the next moment the girls had taken their
      seats in a crowded compartment and were off to town. They arrived in
      London between twelve and one o'clock, and found themselves landed at
      Waterloo. Now, Waterloo is not the nicest station in the world for two
      very young girls to arrive at midnight, particularly when they have not
      the faintest idea where to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go straight to the waiting room and ask the woman there what we
      had best do," said Molly, who still immensely enjoyed taking the lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora followed her companion quite willingly. Her worst fears about her
      father were held in abeyance, now that she was really on her way to him.
      The girls entered the waiting room. A tired-looking woman was busy putting
      out the gas, and reducing the room to darkness for the night. She turned
      round as the girls came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm shutting up, ladies," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but please advise us," said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so, miss? What am I to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be paid well," said Molly, "so you need not look so angry. Can you
      take us home to your place until the morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does this mean?" said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'll explain," said Molly. "We're two runaways. I don't mind telling
      you that we are, because it's a fact. It is important that we should leave
      home. We don't want to be traced. Will you give us lodging?&mdash;any
      sort. We don't mind how small the room is. We want to be at Euston at an
      early hour in the morning; we are going to Holyhead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear!" said the woman; "and does this really mean money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means five shillings," said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten" was on Nora's lips; but Molly silenced her with a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no use in overpaying her; she won't be half as civil," whispered
      Molly to Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's five shillings you'll get," she repeated in a firm voice. "Here, I
      have got the change; you can look in my purse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly opened her purse as she spoke. The woman, a Mrs. Terry by name, did
      look in. She saw the shine of gold and several half-crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, to be sure!" she said. "But you'll promise not to get me into a
      scrape?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't even ask you your name. You can let us out of the house in time
      for us to catch the first train from Euston. We shall be off and away
      before we are discovered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we'll remember you all our lives if you'll help us," said Nora. Then
      she added, tears filling her pretty eyes, "It's my father, please, kind
      woman; he has been shot at and is very ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who wants to keep you from your father, you poor thing?" said the
      woman. "Oh, if it's that, and there's no lovers in the question, I don't
      mind helping you both. It don't do for young girls to be wandering about
      the streets alone at night. You come with me, honeys. I can't take you for
      nothing, but I'll give you supper and breakfast, and the best bed I can,
      for five shillings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, in Mrs. Terry's company, the two girls left Waterloo Station.
      She walked down a somewhat narrow side-street, crossed another, and they
      presently found themselves in a little, old-fashioned square. The square
      was very old indeed, belonging to quite a dead-and-gone period of the
      world. The woman stopped at a house which once had been large and stately;
      doubtless in days gone by it had sheltered goodly personages and had
      listened to the laughter of the rich and well-to-do; but in its old age
      the house was let out in tenements, and Mrs. Terry owned a couple of rooms
      at the very top.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the girls up the dirty stairs, opened the door of a not
      uncomfortable sitting room, and ushered them in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There now, honeys," she said; "the best I can do for you both is the sofa
      for one and my bed for the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said Nora, "we would not dream of taking your bed; and, for that
      matter, I could not sleep," she added. "If you will let me have a couple
      of chairs I shall lie down on them and wait as best I can until the
      morning. Oh, I have often done it at home and thought it great fun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you must each have a bit of supper first; it don't do for young
      girls to go to bed hungry, more particularly when they have a journey
      before them. I'll get you some bread and cheese and a glass of milk each&mdash;unless,
      indeed, you would prefer beer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, we would much rather have milk," said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman bustled about, and soon came in with a jug of milk, a couple of
      glasses, some bread, and some indifferent butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can have the cheese if you really want it," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; this will do beautifully," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then, my dears, I'll leave you now for the night. The lamp will burn
      all night. It will be lonely for young girls to be in the dark; and I'll
      promise to call you at five o'clock. There's a train leaves Euston between
      six and seven that you had better catch, unless you want them as is
      hindering you from flight to stop you. I am interested in this poor young
      lady who wants to see her father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you; you are a perfect darling!" said Nora. "I'll come and see
      you some day when I am happy again, and tell you all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless your kind heart, honey! I'm glad to be able to do something for
      those who are in trouble. Now then, lie down and have a bit of sleep. I'll
      wake you sure and certain, and you shan't stir, the two of you, until you
      have had a hot cup of tea each."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Terry was as good as her word. She called the girls in good time, and
      gave them quite a comfortable breakfast before they started. The tea was
      hot; the bread was good&mdash;what else did they want?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora awoke from a very short and broken slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soon I shall be back again," she thought. "No matter how changed and
      ruined the place is, I shall be with him once more. Oh, my darling, my
      heart's darling, I shall kiss you again! Oh! I am happy at the thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Terry herself accompanied them to Euston. It was too early to get a
      cab; she asked them if they were good walkers. They said they were. She
      took them by the shortest routes; and, somewhat tired, but still full of a
      strange exultation, they found themselves at the great station. Mrs. Terry
      saw them into their train, and with many loudly uttered blessings started
      them on their journey. She would not touch anything more than the five
      shillings, and tears were in her eyes as she looked her last at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless them, and particularly that little Irish girl. Haven't she just
      got the cunningest, sweetest way in all the world?" thought the good
      woman. "I do hope her father will be better when she gets to him. Don't
      she love him just!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it had been the most daring scheme, the wildest sort of adventure,
      for two girls to undertake, and yet it was crowned with success. They were
      too far on their journey for Mrs. Hartrick, however much she might wish
      it, to rescue them. She might be as angry as she pleased; but nothing now
      could get them back. She accordingly did the very best thing she could do&mdash;telegraphed
      to Mr. Hartrick to say that they had absolutely run away, but begged of
      him to meet them in Dublin. This the good man did. He met them both on the
      pier, received them quietly, without much demonstration; but then, looking
      into Nora's anxious face, his own softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have come, Nora, and against my will," he said. "Are you sorry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit, Uncle George," she answered. "I would have come against the
      wills of a thousand uncles if father were ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I have nothing to say," he answered, with a smile, "at least to you;
      but, Molly, I shall have something to talk to you about presently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was very good of you to meet us, father. Was mother terribly angry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could you expect her to be? You have behaved very badly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so. I did the only possible thing to save Nora's heart from
      breaking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me," said Mr. Hartrick slowly, "that you all think of nothing
      but the heart of Nora. I am almost sorry now that I ever asked her to come
      to us in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's home again; it's home again!" cried the Irish girl as she paced
      up and down the platform. "Molly, do listen to the brogue. Isn't it just
      delicious? Come along, and let's talk to this poor old Irish beggar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but he doesn't look at all pleasant," said Molly, backing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless the crayther, but he is pleasant," said Nora. "I must go and have a
      chat with him." She caught hold of Molly's hand, and dragged her to the
      edge of the pavement, where an old man, with almost blind eyes, was seated
      in front of a large basket of rosy apples.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how are you this morning, father?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, then, it's the top of the morning to yez, honey," was the instant
      reply. "And how is yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well indeed," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it's I that am delighted to see yez, though see yez I can't. Oh,
      then, I hope that it's a long life and plenty you'll have before you, my
      sweet, dear, illigant young lady&mdash;a good bed to lie on, and plenty to
      eat and drink. If you has them, what else could ail yez? Good-by to yez;
      good-by to yez."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora slipped a couple of pence into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The blessings of the Vargin and all the Saints be on your head, miss. Oh!
      it's I that am glad to see yez. God's blessing on yez a thousand times."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora took the old man's hand and wrung it. He raised the white little hand
      to his lips and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There now," he said, "I have kissed yez; and these lips shan't see wather
      again for many a long day&mdash;that they shan't. I wouldn't wash off the
      taste of your hand, honey, for a bag of yellow gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an extraordinary man!" said Molly. "Have you known him all your
      life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Known him all my life!" said Nora. "Never laid eyes on him before; that's
      the way we always talk to one another. Oh, I can tell you we love each
      other here in Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems so," answered Molly, in some astonishment. "Dear me! if you
      address a total stranger so, how will you speak to those you really love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wait and see," answered Nora, her dark-blue eyes shining, and a mist
      of tears dimming their brightness; "you wait and see. Ah, it's past words
      we are sometimes; but you wait and you'll soon see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. O'Shanaghgan was pronounced better, although Mr. Hartrick had to admit
      that he was weak and fretful; and, now that Nora had come, it was
      extremely likely that her presence would do her father a sight of good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew it, Uncle George," she answered as they seated themselves in the
      railway carriage preparatory to going back to O'Shanaghgan&mdash;"I knew
      it, and that was why I came. You, uncle, are very wise," she added; "and
      yours is a beautiful, neat, orderly country; and you are very kind, and
      very clever; and you have been awfully good to the Irish girl&mdash;awfully
      good; and she is very ignorant; and you know a great deal; but one thing
      she does know best, and that is, the love and the longing in the heart of
      her own dear father. Oh, hurrah! I'm home again; I'm home again! Erin go
      bragh! Erin go bragh!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; THE WILD IRISH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The somewhat slow Irish train jogged along its way; it never put itself
      out, did that special train, starting when it pleased, and arriving when
      it chose at its destination. Its guard, Jerry by name, was of a like mind
      with itself; there was no hurry about Jerry; he took the world "aisy," as
      he expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the good of fretting?" he used to say. "What can't be cured must
      be endured. I hurry no man's cattle; and my train, she goes when she
      likes, and I aint going to hurry her, not I."
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion Jerry was known to remark to a somewhat belated traveler:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, miss, is it hurrying ye are to meet the train? Why, then, you
      can take your time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jerry!" said this anxious person, fixing her eyes on his face in
      great excitement, "I forgot a most important parcel at a shop half a mile
      away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run and fetch it, then, honey," replied Jerry, "and I'll keep her a bit
      longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      This the lady accordingly did. When she returned, the heads of all the
      other angry passengers were out of the windows expostulating with Jerry as
      to the cause of the delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurry up, miss," he said then. He popped her into a compartment, and she,
      as he called the train, moved slowly out of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times, too, without the smallest provocation, Jerry would stop this
      special train because a little "pigeen" had got off one of the trucks and
      was running along the line. He and the porter shouted and raced after the
      animal, caught it, and brought it back to the train. On another occasion
      he calmly informed a rather important passenger, "Ye had best get out
      here, for she's bust." "She" happened to be the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this train now got English Molly and Irish Nora. Mr. Hartrick
      pronounced it quite the vilest service he had ever traveled by. He began
      to grumble the moment he got into the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It crawls," he said; "and it absolutely has the cheek to call itself an
      express."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Nora, with her head out of the window, was shouting to Jerry, who came
      toward her full of blessings, anxious to shake her purty white hand, and
      telling her that he was as glad as a shower of gould to have her back
      again in the old country.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, the slow, very slow journey came to an end; and just
      after sunset the party found themselves at the little wayside station.
      Here a sight met Nora's eyes which displeased her exceedingly. Instead of
      the old outside car which her father used to drive, with the shabby old
      retainer, whose livery had long ago seen its best days, there arrived a
      smart groom, in the newest of livery, with a cockade in his hat. He
      touched his hat respectfully to Mr. Hartrick, and gave a quick glance
      round at Nora and Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the brougham outside, Dennis?" was Mr. Hartrick's response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; it has been waiting for half an hour; the train is a bit late,
      as usual, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not tell me that this train is ever in time," said Mr. Hartrick.
      "Well, girls, come along; I told Dennis to meet us, and here we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly thought nothing at all of the neat brougham, with its pair of
      spirited grays; she was accustomed to driving in the better-class of
      carriage all her life; but Nora turned first pale and then crimson. She
      got into the carriage, and sat back in a corner; tears were brimming to
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the first. How am I to bear all the rest?" she said to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartrick, who had hoped that Nora would be pleased with the brougham,
      with Dennis himself, with the whole very stylish get-up, was mortified at
      her silence, and, taking her hand, tried to draw her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, little girl," he said, "I hope you will like the improvements I
      have made in the Castle. I have done it all at your instigation,
      remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At my instigation?" cried Nora. "Oh, no, Uncle George, that you have
      not."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her in some amazement, then closed his lips, and said nothing
      more. Molly longed to get her father alone, in order to explain Nora's
      peculiar conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is difficult for an Englishman to understand her," thought Molly. "I
      do, and I think her altogether charming; but father, who has gone to this
      enormous expense and trouble, will be put out if she does not show a
      little gratitude. I will tell her that she must; I will take the very
      first opportunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      And now they were turning in at the well-known gates. These gates were
      painted white, whereas they had been almost reduced to their native wood.
      The avenue was quite tidy, no weeds anywhere; but Nora almost refused to
      look out. One by one the familiar trees seemed to pass by her as she was
      bowled rapidly along in the new brougham, as if they were so many ghosts
      saying good-by. But then there was the roar&mdash;the real, real, grand
      roar&mdash;of the Atlantic in her ears. No amount of tidiness, nothing
      could ever alter that sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hurrah for the sea!" she said. She flung down the window and popped
      out her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartrick nodded to Molly. "She will see a great deal more to delight
      her than just the old ocean," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly was silent. They arrived at the house; the butler was standing on
      the steps, a nice, stylish-looking Englishman, in neat livery. He came
      down, opened the carriage door, let down the steps, and offered his arm to
      Nora to alight; but she pushed past him, bounded up the steps, and the
      next moment found herself in her mother's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do, my dear Nora?" said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan. "I am glad to see
      you, dear, but also surprised. You acted in your usual headstrong
      fashion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, another time, mother. Mummy, how are you? I am glad to see you again;
      but don't scold me now; just wait. I'll bear it all patiently another
      time. How is the dad, mummy?&mdash;how is the dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father is doing nicely, Nora; there was not the slightest occasion
      for you to hurry off and give such trouble and annoyance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suppose I have given annoyance to father," said Nora. "Where is
      he&mdash;in his old room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; we moved him upstairs to the best bedroom. We thought it the wisest
      thing to do; he was in considerable pain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best bedroom? Which is the best bedroom?" said Nora. "Your room,
      mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The room next to mine, darling. And just come and have a look at the
      drawing room, Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go to father first," said Nora. "Don't keep me; I can't stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      She forgot Molly; she forgot her uncle; she even forgot her mother. In a
      moment she was bounding upstairs over those thick Axminster carpets&mdash;those
      awful carpets, into which her feet sank&mdash;down a corridor, also
      heavily lined with Axminster, past great velvet curtains, which seemed to
      stifle her as she pushed them aside, and the next instant she had burst
      open a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the old days this room had been absolutely destitute of furniture. In
      the older days again it had been the spare room of Castle O'Shanaghgan.
      Here hospitality had reigned; here guests of every degree had found a
      hearty welcome, an invitation to stay as long as they pleased, and the
      best that the Castle could afford for their accommodation. When Nora had
      left O'Shanaghgan, the only thing that had remained in the old room was a
      huge four-poster. Even the mattress from this old bed had been removed;
      the curtains had been taken from the windows; the three great windows were
      bare of both blinds and curtains. Now a soft carpet covered the entire
      floor; a neat modern Albert bed stood in a recess; there were heavy
      curtains to the windows, and Venetian blinds, which were so arranged as to
      temper the light. But the light of the sunset had already faded, and it
      was twilight when Nora popped her wild, excited little face round the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bed lay a gaunt figure, unshaven, with a beard of a week's growth.
      Two great eyes looked out of caverns, then two arms were stretched out,
      and Nora was clasped to her father's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then, I have you again; may God be praised for all His mercies," said
      the Squire in a great, deep hoarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora lay absolutely motionless for nearly half a minute in his arms, then
      she raised herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," she said, "that was good. I hungered for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I also hungered for it, my darling," said the Squire. "Let me look at
      you, Light o' the Morning; get a light somehow, and let me see your bonny,
      bonny, sweet, sweet face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there's a fire in the grate," said Nora. "Are there any matches?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Matches, bedad!" said the Squire; "there's everything that's wanted. It's
      perfectly horrible. They are in a silver box, too, bedad! What do we want
      with it? Twist up a bit of paper, do, Nora, like a good girl, and light
      the glim the old way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora caught at her father's humor at once. She had already flung off her
      hat and jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I will," she said, "and with all the heart in the world." She
      tore a long strip from the local paper, which was lying on a chair near
      by, twisted it, lit it in the fire, and then applied it to a candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only light one candle, for the love of heaven, child," said the Squire.
      "I don't want to see too many of the fal-lals. Now then, that's better;
      bring the light up to the bed. Oh, what I have suffered with curtains, and
      carpets, and&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too awful, father," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it, child. That's the first cheery word I have heard for the last
      six weeks&mdash;too awful I should think it is. They are smothering me
      between them, Nora. I shall never get up and breathe the free air again;
      but when you came in you brought a breath of air with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's open the window. There's a gale coming up, We'll have some air,"
      said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, Light o' the Morning, they say I'll get bronchitis if the
      window is opened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They! Who are they?" said Nora, with scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you wouldn't believe it, but they had a doctor down from Dublin to
      see me. I don't believe he had a scrap of real Irish blood in him, for he
      said I was to be nursed and messed over, and gruels and all kinds of
      things brought to my bedside&mdash;I who would have liked a fine potato
      with a pinch of salt better than anything under the sun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have your potato and your pinch of salt now that I am back," said
      Nora. "I mean to be mistress of this room."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire gave a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it lovely to hear her?" he said. "Don't it do me a sight of good?
      There, open the window wide, Nora, before your mother comes in. Oh, your
      mother is as pleased as Punch, and for her sake I'd bear a good deal; but
      I am a changed man. The old times are gone, never to return. Call this
      place Castle O'Shanaghgan. It may be suitable for an English nobleman to
      live in, but it's not my style; it's not fit for an Irish squire. We are
      free over here, and we don't go in for luxuries and smotherations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, father, I had to go through a great deal of that in England," said
      Nora. "It's awful to think that sort of life has come here; but there&mdash;there's
      the window wide open. Do you feel a bit of a breeze, dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I do; let me breathe it in. Prop me up in bed, Nora. They said
      I was to lie flat on my back, but, bedad! I won't now that you have come
      back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora pushed some pillows under her father, and sat behind him to support
      him, and at last she got him to sit up in bed with his face turned to the
      wide-open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blinds were rattling, the curtains were being blown into the room, and
      the soft, wild sound of the sea fell on his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I'm better now," he said; "my lungs are cleared at bit. You had best
      shut the window before your lady-mother comes in. And put the candle so
      that I can't see the fal-lals too much," he continued; "but place it so
      that I can gaze at your bonny face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must tell me how you were hurt, father, and where."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bedad! then, I won't&mdash;not to-night. I want to have everything as
      cheerful as possible to-night. My little girl has come back&mdash;the joy
      of my heart, the light of my eyes, the top of the morning, and I'm not
      going to fret about anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't&mdash;you needn't," said Nora. "Oh! it is good to see you
      again. There never was anybody like you in all the world. And you were
      longing for Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, don't you be fishing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you were&mdash;wern't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure&mdash;to be sure. Here, then, let me grip hold of your little
      hand. I never saw such a tiny little paw. And so they haven't made a fine
      English lady of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not they," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you ran away to see your old dad? Why, then, you have the spirit of
      the old O'Shanaghgans in you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horses would not have kept me from you," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might have known as much. How I laughed when your mother brought in the
      telegram from your Aunt Grace this morning! And weren't they in a fuss,
      and wasn't your Uncle George as cross as he could be, and your mother
      rampaging up and down the room until I said, 'If you want to bring on the
      fever, you'll go on like that, Ellen; and then she went out, and I heard
      her talking to your uncle in the passage. Clap, clap went their tongues. I
      never knew anything like English people; they never talk a grain of
      anything amusing; that's the worst of it. Why, it's the truth I'm telling
      you, darling; I haven't had a hearty laugh since you left home. I'll do
      fine now. When they were out of the room didn't I give way! I gave two
      loud guffaws, that I did, when I thought of the trick you had played them.
      Ah, you're a true daughter of the old race!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora nestled up to her father, squeezing his hand now and then, and
      looking into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have a fine time to-morrow, and the next day, and the next day, and
      the next," she said. "Oh! I am determined to be near you. But isn't there
      one little place in the house left bare, father, where we can go and have
      a happy moment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never a square inch," said the Squire, looking at her solemnly. "It's too
      awful; even the attics have been cleared out and put in order, for the
      servants, forsooth! says your Uncle George."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do we want so many retainers for? I am sure, now, if they would take
      a good houseful of some of the poor villagers and plant them up in those
      attics, there would be some sense in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Nora, couldn't we get a bit of a place just like the old place, all
      to ourselves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll think it over," said Nora; "we'll manage somehow. We can't stand
      feather-beds for ever and ever, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark to her," said the Squire; "you're a girl after my own heart, Light
      o' the Morning, and it's glad I am to see you, and to have you back
      again."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; ALTERATIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Nora and her father were talking together there came a sound of a
      ponderous gong through the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" said Nora, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may well ask 'What's that?'" replied the Squire. "It's the
      dinner-gong. There's dinner now in the evening, bedad! and up to seven
      courses, by the same token. I sat out one or two of them; but, bless my
      soul! I couldn't stand too much of that sort of thing. You had best go and
      put on something fine. Your mother dresses in velvet and silk and jewels
      for dinner. She looks wonderful; she is a very fine woman indeed, is your
      mother. I am as proud as Punch of her; but, all the same, it is too much
      to endure every day. She is dressed for all the world as though she were
      going to a ball at the Lord-Lieutenant's in Dublin. It's past standing;
      but you had best go down and join 'em, Norrie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I. I am going to stay here," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, darling pet; you had best go down, enjoy your dinner, and come
      back and tell me about it. It will be fun to hear your description. You
      mimic 'em as much as you like, Norrie; take 'em off. Now, none of your
      coaxing and canoodling ways; off you go. You shall come back later on, and
      tell me all about it. Oh, they are stiff and stately, and they'll never
      know you and I are laughing at 'em up our sleeves. Now, be off with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, unwillingly, Nora went. In the corridor outside she met her cousin
      Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you haven't begun to dress yet," said Molly; "and I'm going down to
      dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bother dress!" said Nora. "I am home again. Mother can't expect me to
      dress." She rushed past her cousin. She was too excited to have any
      sympathy then with English Molly. She ran up to her own room, and stood
      with a sense of dismay on the threshold. It had always been a beautiful
      room, with its noble proportions and its splendid view; and it was now
      furnished exquisitely as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan had great taste. She had taken immense pains with Nora's
      room; had thought it all out, and got it papered and painted after a
      scheme of color of her own. The furniture was of light wood&mdash;the room
      was fit to be the bower of a gracious and lovely maiden; there were new
      books in the little bookcase hanging up by the bedside. Everything was new
      and everything was beautiful. There was no sense of bad taste about the
      room; it was furnished harmoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora stood and gazed at it, and her heart sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! it is kind of mother; it is beautiful," she said to herself; "but am
      I never, never, never to lie down in the little old bed again? Am I never
      to pour water out of the cracked old jug? Am I never to look at myself in
      the distorted glass? Oh, dear! oh, dear! how I did love looking at myself
      in the old glass, which made one cheek much more swollen than the other,
      and one eyebrow went up a quarter of an inch above the other, and my mouth
      was a little crooked! It is perfectly horrid to know one's self all one's
      life long with a swollen cheek and a crooked mouth, and then see classical
      features without a scrap of fun in them. Oh, dear! But I suppose I had
      best get ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Nora washed her face and hands, and ran downstairs. The dining room
      looked heavy and massive, and the footman and the butler attended
      noiselessly; and Mr. Hartrick at the foot of the table and Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan at the head looked as stately a pair as could be found in the
      length and breadth of the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly, nicely dressed in her dinner-frock, was quite in keeping with the
      elder pair; but wild Nora, still wearing her gray traveling-dress, felt
      herself out of place. Her cheeks were flushed with the excitement of
      seeing her father; her hair was wild and disarranged. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan
      looked at her all over with marked disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, she looks scarcely pretty," thought the mother to herself. "How
      tired and fagged she appears! Dear, dear! if after all the trouble I have
      gone to, Nora disappoints me in this way, life will really not be worth
      living."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. O'Shanaghgan could scarcely suppress the joy which was now
      filling her life. She was the mistress of a noble home; she was at the
      head of quite the finest establishment in the county. Already all the best
      county folk had called upon her several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is sad to state that these great and rich people had rather neglected
      the lady of the Castle during the last few years; but now that she drove
      about behind a pair of horses, that her house was refurnished, that wealth
      seemed to have filled all her coffers, she was certainly worth attending
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that you have come back, Nora," said her mother in the course of the
      meal, "I wish to say that I have several invitations for you, and that
      Molly can accept too." She looked with kindness at Molly, who, if only
      Nora had been happy, would have thoroughly enjoyed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must show you the drawing room after dinner, my dear," said her mother.
      "It is really a magnificent room. And I must also show you my morning
      room, and the library, and your father's smoking room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a splendid house, you know, Ellen," said Mr. Hartrick to his
      sister, "and pays for doing up. Why, a house like this in any habitable
      part of England would fetch a colossal fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora sighed and shrugged her shoulders. Molly glanced at her, and the word
      "Jehoshaphat!" was almost trembling on her lips. She kept it back,
      however; she was wonderfully on her good behavior to-night. At last the
      long and dreary meal came to an end. Nora could scarcely suppress her
      yawns of utter weariness. She began to think of nothing but lying down,
      shutting her eyes, and going into a long and dreamless slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan rose from the table and sailed out of the room. A
      footman flung open the door for her, and Nora and Molly followed in her
      wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be with you presently in the drawing room, Ellen," said Mr. Hartrick
      to his sister; "but first of all I'll just go up and have a smoke with
      O'Shanaghgan. You found your father much better to-night, did you not,
      Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought father looked very bad indeed," said Nora. She could not add
      another word; she went out into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan took her hand, squeezing it up in a tight pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought not to speak in that tone to your uncle," she said; "you can
      never, never know all that he has done for us. He is the noblest, the most
      generous, the best man in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know all that, mother; I know all that," said Nora. She did not
      add, "But for me he would never have done it. It was I who inserted the
      thin edge of the wedge." Her tone was gentle; her mother looked at her
      with a softening of her own face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, dear," she said, "your Uncle George has taken a great fancy to you.
      Notwithstanding your eccentricities, Nora&mdash;and they are considerable&mdash;he
      says you have the making of a fine girl. But come, we must not neglect
      your cousin. Come here, dear Molly; you and Nora will be interested in
      seeing what a beautiful place Castle O'Shanaghgan is now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly took hold of Nora's other hand, and they entered the drawing room.
      It was lit with soft candles in many sconces; the blinds were down; across
      the windows were drawn curtains of Liberty silk of the palest, softest
      shade of rose. On the floor was a carpet of many soft colors cunningly
      mingled. The walls were painted a pale artistic green, large mirrors were
      introduced here and there, and old family portraits, all newly framed, of
      dead and gone O'Shanaghgans, hung on the painted walls. There were new
      tables, knick-knacks&mdash;all the various things which constitute the
      drawing room of an English lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora felt for one brief, passionate, angry moment that she was back again
      at The Laurels; but then, seeing the light in her mother's eyes, the pink
      flush of happiness on her cheeks, she restrained herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It makes you happy, mummy," she said, "and&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what do you think of it, my darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a very beautiful room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! that is right. I thought my little wildflower would appreciate all
      these things when she came back again. Ah, Nora! you have been a naughty,
      wild imp; but your father was delighted when he heard what you had done.
      Of course I am terribly angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you are not, mummy; you are pleased to see me again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to have you back, Nora; but as to being pleased, how could I
      be? However, you can stay here for a fortnight or so now that you have
      come; and then, when your dear uncle leaves us, you and Molly can go back
      with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora did not say anything; but a stubborn look came into her face which
      her mother knew of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the drawing room they went to the library, which had also undergone
      complete rejuvenation. The walls were laden with standard works of
      different kinds; but some of the shelves were still empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old books, your uncle says, were of great value," said Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan, "and he sent them all to Dublin to be rebound. They have not
      come back yet. They are to be bound in old calf, and will suit the rest of
      the room. Is it not a magnificent apartment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora said "Yes" in a somewhat dreamy voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then went to her mother's morning-room, and then on to the Squire's
      smoking-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They might at least have left this alone," thought the girl. "They might
      at least have left this one room, where he could retire when he felt quite
      choked by all the furniture in the rest of the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      But even the Squire's smoking-room was changed into the smoking-room of an
      English gentleman. There were deep easy-chairs covered with leather; there
      were racks for pipes, and great brass dogs before the fireplace; on the
      floor was a thick carpet. Nora felt as if she longed to give it a savage
      kick.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the terrible ordeal of going through the&mdash;to her, utterly
      ruined&mdash;house was over, and she and Molly found themselves alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go up to your father for a few minutes," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan,
      nodding to Nora. "You and your cousin will like to have a chat; and then,
      my dears, I should recommend you both to go to bed as early as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were back again in the big drawing room Nora gave Molly a wild
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come out," she said; "at least out of doors the air is the same as of
      old."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly caught up a shawl and wrapped it round her head; but Nora went out
      just as she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll catch cold," said English Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I catch cold in my native land!" replied Irish Nora. "How little you know
      me! Oh, come, Molly, I am going to be wild; I am going to give way."
    </p>
    <p>
      They both stepped outside on the broad gravel sweep. The moon was up, and
      it was shining over everything. In the moonlight Castle O'Shanaghgan
      looked very much as it had done before. The moon had always glorified the
      old place, and it glorified it still. Nora stood and gazed around her; up
      to the tops of the mountains, with their dark summits clearly defined
      against the evening sky; across the wide breadth of the Atlantic; over the
      thick plantations, the fields, and the huge trees in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all the same," she said, with a glad laugh; "thank God it is all the
      same. Even your father, Molly, cannot destroy the place outside, at
      least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh Nora, it is such a lovely, lovely place!" said Molly. "Cannot you be
      happy in it with its modern dress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happy," said Nora, suddenly brought back to her sense of misery by the
      word. "I am thankful that my father is not so ill; but&mdash;but you must
      help, Molly. Promise that you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure I'd do anything in the world," said Molly. "I think I have been
      very good to-day. I have kept in my naughty words, Jehoshaphat and Moses
      and Elephants, and all the rest. What do you want me to do, Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must get him out of that room," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him? You mean your father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he will never recover there. I have been thinking and thinking, and
      I'll have my plan ready by the morning; only you must help me. I'll get
      Hannah Croneen to come in, and we'll do it between us if you can help me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is it?" said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you in the morning; you wait and see."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. &mdash; THE LION IN HIS CAGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Squire was better, and not better. He had received a very nasty
      flesh-wound in the thigh; but the bullet had been extracted. There was not
      the slightest clew to the identity of his would-be murderer. The Squire
      himself had said nothing. He had been found almost bleeding to death by
      the roadside; the alarm had been given, and in terror and consternation
      his own tenants had brought him home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire could have said a good deal, but he said nothing. The police
      came and asked him questions, but he kept his lips closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't see the man," he said after a pause. "Somebody fired, of course;
      but I can't tell who, for I saw no one; it was from behind the hedge. Why
      the scoundrel who wanted to do for me didn't shoot a little higher up
      puzzles me. But there, let it rest&mdash;let it rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the neighbors and the country had to let it rest, for there was no
      evidence against anyone. Amongst those who came to inquire after the
      Squire was Andy Neil. He came often, and was full of commiseration, and
      loudly cursed the brute who had very nearly done for his old landlord. But
      the neighbors had suspicions with regard to Andy, for he had been turned
      out of his cot in the mountains, and was living in the village now. They
      scowled at him when he passed, and turned aside; and his own face looked
      more miserable than ever. Still, he came daily up to the big kitchen to
      inquire for the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor said there was no reason whatever why Mr. O'Shanaghgan should
      not get quite well. He was by no means old&mdash;not more than fifty;
      there was not the slightest occasion for a break-down, and yet, to all
      appearance, a break-down there was. The Squire got morose; he hardly ever
      smiled; even Nora's presence scarcely drew a hearty guffaw from his lips.
      The doctors were puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can be wrong?" they said. But Nora herself knew very well what was
      wrong. She and her father were the only ones who did know. She knew that
      the old lion was dying in captivity; that he was absolutely succumbing to
      the close and smothered life which he was now leading. He wanted the free
      air of his native mountains; he wanted the old life, now gone for ever,
      back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true the place is saved, Norrie," he said once to his daughter,
      "and I haven't a word to say. I would be the most ungrateful dog in
      existence if I breathed a single word of complaint. The place is saved;
      and though it nominally belongs now to your Uncle George, to all intents
      and purposes it is my place, and he gives me to understand that at my
      death it goes to my boy. Yes, he has done a noble deed, and of course I
      admire him immensely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so do I, father," said Nora; but she looked thoughtful and troubled;
      and one day, after she had been in her father's room for some time, when
      she met her uncle in the avenue she spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear girl," he said, "what about coming back with me to England
      when I go next week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not to be thought of, Uncle George. How can I leave my father while
      he is ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true. I have been thinking about him. The doctors are a little
      distressed at his growing weakness. They cannot quite understand it.
      Tonics have been given to him and every imaginable thing has been done. He
      wants for nothing; his nourishment is of the best; still he makes no way.
      It is puzzling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, my dear girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might do all that sort of thing for an eagle, you know," said Nora,
      raising her clear eyes and fixing them on her uncle's face. "You might
      give him everything in his prison, much more than he had when he was free;
      but, all the same, he would pine and&mdash;and he would die." Tears rose
      to the girl's eyes; she dashed them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear little Nora, I don't in the least see the resemblance," said Mr.
      Hartrick, who felt, and perhaps justly, rather nettled. "You seem to imply
      by your words that I have done your father an injury when I secured the
      home of his ancestors for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, forgive me, Uncle George," said Nora. "I don't really mean to say
      anything against you, for you are just splendid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartrick did not reply; he looked puzzled and thoughtful. Nora, after
      a moment's silence, spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am most grateful to you. I believe you have done what is best&mdash;at
      least what you think best. You have made my mother very happy, and Terence
      will be so pleased; and the tenants&mdash;oh! they will get their rights
      now, their cabins will be repaired, the roofs mended, the windows put in
      fresh, the little gardens stocked for them. Oh, yes, you are behaving most
      generously. Anyone would suppose the place belonged to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which it does," muttered Mr. Hartrick under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have made a great many people happy, only somehow&mdash;somehow it is
      not quite the way to make my father happy, and it is not the way to make
      me happy. But I have nothing more to say, except that I cannot leave my
      father now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must come to us after Christmas, then," said Mr. Hartrick. "I must go
      back next week, and I shall probably take Molly with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! leave her with me here," said Nora suddenly. "I do wish you would;
      the air here is so healthy. Do let her stay, and then perhaps after
      Christmas, when things are different, we might both go back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course things will be different," said Mr. Hartrick. "A new doctor is
      coming to see your father next week, and he will probably change the <i>régime</i>;
      he may order him fresh air, and before long we shall have him strong and
      well amongst us again. He has absolutely nothing wrong except&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except that he has everything wrong," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, my dear child, I will think over your suggestion that Molly
      should stay with you; and in the meantime remember that we are all coming
      to O'Shanaghgan for Christmas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All of you!" said Nora in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, all of us. Your aunt has never spent a real old-fashioned Christmas
      in her life, and I mean her to have it this year. I shall bring over some
      of our English habits to this place. We will roast an ox whole, and have
      huge bonfires, and all kinds of things, and the tenantry shall have a
      right good time. There, Nora, you smile; that pleases you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are so kind," she said. She clasped his hands in both of hers, and
      then turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There never was anyone kinder," thought the girl to herself; "but all the
      same he does not understand." She re-entered the house and went up to her
      father's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire was lying on his back. The days were now getting short, for
      November had begun. There was a big fire in the grate; the Squire panted
      in the hot room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just come in here," he said to Nora. "Don't make much noise; lock the
      door&mdash;will you, pet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now fling the window wide open; let me get a breath of air."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora did open the window, but the air was moist and damp from the
      Atlantic, and even she, fearless as she was, hesitated when she heard her
      father's cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, child, there," he said; "it's the lungs beginning to work properly
      again. Now then, you can shut it up; I hear a step. For Heaven's sake,
      Nora, be quick, or your mother may come in, and won't she be making a
      fuss! There, unlock the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are worse, father; you are worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else can you expect? They don't chain up wild animals and expect
      them to get well. I never lived through anything of this sort before, and
      it's just smothering me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patrick," she said, "would you like some sweetbread and a bit of pheasant
      for your dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know what I'd like?" roared the Squire. "A great big mealy potato,
      with a pinch of salt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan uttered a sigh, and the color rushed into her pale
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word," she said, "you are downright vulgar."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire gave a feeble guffaw. Nora's heart beat as she noticed how
      feeble it was. She left the room, because she could not stay there another
      moment. The time had come to act. She had hesitated long, but she would
      hesitate no longer. She ran downstairs. The first person she saw was
      Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Molly, "how is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very bad indeed," said Nora; "there's not a moment to lose. Something
      must be done, and quickly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come out with me; I have a thought in my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora and Molly went outside. They crossed the avenue, went along the
      plantation at the back, and soon found themselves in the huge yard which
      flanked the back of the house. In a distant part of the yard was a barn,
      and this barn Nora now entered. It was untidy; the doors fitted badly; the
      floor was of clay. It was quite empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora gave a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dreamed of this barn last night," she said. "I think it is the very
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what, Nora; for what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to have father moved here to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora, what nonsense you are talking! You will kill him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Save his life, you mean," said Nora. "I am going to get a bedstead, a
      straw paillasse, and an old hard mattress, and I am going to have them put
      here; and we'll get a bit of tarpaulin to put on the floor, to prevent the
      damp coming up; and I'll put a curtain across this window so that he
      needn't have too much draught, the darling; and there shall be nothing
      else in the room except a wooden table. He shall have his potatoes and
      salt, and his bit of salt bacon, if he wishes, and he shall have his great
      big bare room. I tell you what it is, Molly, he'll never get well unless
      he is brought here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a girl you are! But how will you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave it to me. Do you mind driving with me on the outside car as far as
      Cronane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The outside car? I have never been on it yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come along; I'll introduce you to the sweetest conveyance in the
      world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora's spirits rose at the thought of immediate action.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't it surprise and delight him?" she said. She went up to one of the
      grooms. He was an English groom, and was somewhat surprised at the
      appearance of the young lady in the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do for you, miss?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want Angus," answered Nora. "Where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Angus was one of the few old Irish servants who were still left at Castle
      O'Shanaghgan. He now came forward in a sheepish kind of way; but when he
      saw Nora his face lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put one of the horses to the outside car at once&mdash;Black Bess if you
      can," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss," said the man, "with all the pleasure in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't take it round to the front door. Miss Molly and I want to drive to
      Cronane. You needn't come with us, Angus; just put the horse to, and I'll
      drive myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, in less than ten minutes' time the two girls were driving in
      the direction of Cronane. Molly, brave as she was, had some difficulty in
      keeping on. She clung to the sides of the car and panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora, as sure as Jehoshaphat and Elephants, I'll be flung out on to the
      highroad!" cried Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit easy and nothing will happen," said Nora, who was seated comfortably
      herself at the other side and was driving with vigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they reached Cronane, which looked just as dilapidated as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the darling place! Isn't it a relief to see it?" said Nora. "Don't I
      love that gate off its hinges! It's a sight for sore eyes&mdash;that it
      is."
    </p>
    <p>
      They dashed up the avenue and stopped before the hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing on the steps&mdash;where, indeed, he spent most of his time&mdash;and
      indulging in the luxury of an old church-warden pipe, was Squire Murphy.
      He raised a shout when he saw Nora, and ran down the steps as fast as he
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my bit of a girl, it's good to see you!" he cried. "And who is this
      young lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is my cousin, Molly Hartrick. Molly, may I introduce you to Squire
      Murphy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a grip of the paw, miss," said Squire Murphy, holding out his great
      hand and clasping Molly's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, what can I do for you, Nora alannah? 'Tis I that am glad to see
      you. There's Biddy in the house, and the wife; they'll give you a hearty
      welcome, and no mistake. You come along right in, the pair of yez; come
      right in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I cannot," said Nora. "I want to speak to you alone and at once. Can
      you get one of the boys to hold the horse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure. Dan, you spalpeen! come forward this minute. Now then, hold
      Black Bess, and look alive, lad. Well, Nora, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly stood on the gravel sweep, Nora and the Squire walked a few paces
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's this," said Nora; "you haven't asked yet how father is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is doing fine, they tell me. I see I'm not wanted at O'Shanaghgan;
      and I'm the last man in the world to go there when the cold shoulder is
      shown to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! they would never mean that," said Nora, in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't they mean it, my dear? Haven't I been up to the Castle day
      after day, and asking for the Squire with my heart in my mouth, and ready
      to sit by his side and to colleague with him about old times, and raise a
      laugh in him, and smoke with him; and haven't I been repelled?&mdash;the
      Squire not well enough to see me; madam herself not at home. Oh, I know
      their ways. When you were poor at O'Shanaghgan, then Squire Murphy was
      wanted; but now that you're rich, Squire Murphy can go his own way for
      aught you care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not true, Mr. Murphy," said the girl, her bright blue eyes filling
      with tears. "Oh!" she added, catching his hand impulsively, "don't I know
      it all? But it's not my father's fault; he would give the world to see you&mdash;he
      shall see you. Do you know why he is ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so, Nora? Upon my word, you're a very handsome girl, Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, never mind about my looks now. My father is ill because&mdash;because
      of all the luxury and the riches."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bedad, then, I'm glad to hear it," said the Squire of Cronane. He slapped
      his thigh loudly. "It's the best bit of news I have heard this many a day;
      it surprised me how he could put up with it. And it's killing him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's about it," said Nora. "He must be rescued."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll do what I can," said Squire Murphy. "Will you do this? Will you this
      very day get out the long cart and have an old bedstead put into it, and
      an old paillasse and an old mattress; and will you see that it is taken
      over this very afternoon to O'Shanaghgan? I'll be there, and the bedstead
      shall be put up in the old barn, and father shall sleep in the barn
      to-night, and you and I, Squire, and Hannah Croneen, and Molly, will help
      to move him while the rest of the family are at tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire stared at Nora so long after she had made these remarks that
      she really thought he had taken leave of his senses; then he burst into a
      great loud laugh, clapped his hand to his side, and wrung Nora's until she
      thought he would wring it off. Then he turned back to the house, walking
      so fast that Nora had to run after him. But she knew that she had found
      her ally, and that her father would be saved.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. &mdash; RELEASE OF THE CAPTIVE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      All Nora's wishes were carried into effect. The long cart was got out. An
      old mattress was secured, also an old bedstead. The mattress happened to
      be well aired, for, indeed, it was one on which the Squire himself had
      slept the previous night; but, as he remarked, he would gladly give the
      bed from under him for the sake of his old friend O'Shanaghgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly helped, also Biddy and Nora, in all the preparations, and at last
      the three girls jumped upon the outside car and returned to O'Shanaghgan.
      Biddy felt that she was anything but welcome. She was certainly not
      looking her best. Her dress was of the shabbiest, and her turned-up nose
      looked more celestial than ever. Molly was gazing at her just as if she
      were a sort of curiosity, and finally Biddy resented this close scrutiny,
      and turned to Nora, grasping her by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell her," said Biddy, "that it is very rude to stare in that sort of
      stolid way. If she were an Irish girl she would give a flashing glance and
      then look away again; but that way of staring full and stiff puts a body
      out. Tell her it is not true Irish manners."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jehoshaphat!" exclaimed Molly, "I hear you both whispering together.
      What is it all about? I am nearly wild trying to keep myself on this awful
      car, and I know you are saying something not in my favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are that," cried Biddy; "we are just wishing you would keep your
      English manners to yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly flushed rather indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not know that I was doing anything," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then," cried Biddy, "is it nothing when you are bringing the blushes
      to my cheeks and the palpitation to my heart; and is it nothing to be, as
      it were, exposed to the scorn of the English? Why, then, bedad! I have got
      my nose from the old Irish kings, from whom I am descended, as true as
      true. Blue is my blood, and I am as proud of my ancestry as if I was Queen
      Victoria herself. I see that you have neat, straight features; but you
      have not got a scrap of royal blood in you&mdash;now, have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so," answered Molly, laughing in spite of herself. "Well,
      if it offends you, I will try not to look at you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The drive came to an end, and Nora entered the big, splendidly furnished
      hall, accompanied by Molly and Biddy. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan happened to be
      standing there. She came hurriedly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Nora," she began, but then her eyes fell upon Biddy. Her brows
      went up with a satirical action; she compressed her lips and kept back a
      sigh of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do, Miss Murphy?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am fine, thank you kindly, ma'am," replied Biddy; "and it is sorry I am
      that I had not time to change my dress and put on the pink one with the
      elegant little flounces that my aunt sent me from Dublin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, your present dress will do very well," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan,
      suppressing an internal shudder at the thought of Biddy at the renovated
      Castle of O'Shanaghgan in her dirty pink dress with the flounces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Miss Murphy," she continued, "I am sorry that I cannot ask you to
      stay. The Squire is too unwell to admit of our having friends at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, glory!" cried Biddy, "and how am I to get back again? Why, it was on
      your own outside car that I came across country, and I cannot walk all the
      way back to Cronane. Oh, but what a truly beautiful house! I never saw
      anything like it. Why, it is a sort of palace!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddy's open admiration of the glories of O'Shanaghgan absolutely made the
      good mistress of the mansion smile. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan felt that Nora did
      not really care for the beautiful place&mdash;the grandly furnished rooms
      had brought no enthusiasm or delight to her heart. Nora had tried very
      hard to keep in her real feelings; but her mother was quite sharp enough
      to know what they were. There was little pleasure in taking a girl round
      rooms, corridors, and galleries when she was only forcing herself to say
      pretty things which she did not feel. Molly, of course, had always lived
      in a beautiful and well-furnished house; therefore there was nothing
      exciting in showing her the present magnificence of O'Shanaghgan, and half
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan's pleasure was showing the place in its now regal state
      to her friends. Biddy's remark, therefore, was most fortunate. Even wild,
      unkempt, untaught Irish Biddy was better than no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you what it is," said the good lady, with quite a gracious
      expression stealing over her features, "if you will promise to walk
      softly, and not to make any loud remarks, I will take you through the
      suite of drawing rooms and the big dining room and my morning room; but
      you must promise to be very quiet if I give you this great pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it is glad I'll be, and as mum as a mouse. I'll hold my hands to my
      heart, and keep in everything; but, oh, Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, if I am fit to
      burst now and then, you will let me run to the window and give a big sigh?
      It is all I'll ask, to relieve myself; but mum's the word for everything
      else."
    </p>
    <p>
      On these terms Mrs. O'Shanaghgan conducted her unwelcome guest through the
      rooms, and after a brief tour Biddy joined her companions in the yard.
      Nora was busy sweeping out the barn herself, and, with the aid of Hannah
      Croneen and Molly, was already beginning to put it to rights. Biddy was
      now free to join the other conspirators, and the girls quickly became
      friends under these conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannah proved herself a most valuable ally. She whisked about, dashing
      here and there, raising a whirlwind of dust, but, in Nora's opinion,
      effecting wonders. Angus also was drawn into the midst of the fray. His
      delight and approval of Nora's scheme was almost beyond bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then," he said; "it's this will do the masther good. Oh, then, Miss
      Nora, it's you that has the 'cute ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      A tarpaulin was found and laid upon the floor. From Hannah's cottage a
      small deal table was fetched. A washstand was given by Angus; a cracked
      basin and jug were further secured; and Nora gave implicit directions with
      regard to the boiling of the mealy potatoes and the little scrap of bacon
      on which the Squire was to sup.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will bring them in&mdash;the potatoes, I mean&mdash;in their
      jackets," said the Irish girl, "and have them hot as hot can be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shall screech, that they shall," replied Hannah; "and the bacon, it
      shall be done as tasty and sweet as bacon can be. I'll give the last bit
      of my own little pigeen, with all the heart in the world, for the Squire's
      supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, when the long cart arrived from Cronane, accompanied by the
      Squire and his factotum, Mike, the barn was ready to receive the bedstead,
      the straw paillasse, and the mattress. Nora managed to convey, from the
      depths of the Castle, sheets, blankets, pillows, and a counterpane, and
      everything was in apple-pie order by the time the family was supposed to
      assemble for afternoon tea. This was the hour that Nora had selected for
      having the Squire removed from his feather-bed existence to the more
      breezy life of the barn. It was now the fashion at O'Shanaghgan to make
      quite a state occasion of afternoon tea. The servants, in their grand
      livery, were all well to the fore. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, dressed as became
      the lady of so beautiful a place, sat in her lovely drawing room to
      receive her guests; and the guests came up in many conveyances&mdash;some
      in carriages, some on outside cars, some on dog-carts, some on foot; but,
      come as they would, they came, day after day, to show their respects to
      the lady whom now the whole country delighted to honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these occasions Mr. Hartrick sat with his sister, and helped her to
      entertain her visitors. It had been one of the sore points between Nora
      and her mother that the former would not appear to afternoon tea. Nora had
      made her sick father her excuse. On the present occasion she took good
      care not even to show her face inside the house. But Molly kept watch,
      just behind the plantation, and soon rushed into the yard to say that the
      carriages were beginning to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A curious party have come just now," said Molly, "in such a droll
      carriage, with yellow wheels and a glass body. It looks like a sort of a
      Lord Mayor's coach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it must be the coach of the O'Rorkes," cried Nora. "Fancy Madam
      coming to see mother! Why, Madam will scarcely pay a visit to royalty
      itself. There is no doubt that mother is thought a lot of now. Oh, dear,
      oh, dear, what a frightfully society life we shall have to lead here in
      future! But I have no time to think of mother and her friends just now.
      Squire, will you come upstairs with me to see father? Hannah, please wait
      down here to be ready to help? Angus, you must also come upstairs, and
      wait in the passage outside the Squire's room until I send for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having given her directions, Nora entered the house. All was quiet and
      peaceful. The well trained English servants were, some of them, in the
      kitchen premises, and some of them attending in the hall and drawing
      rooms, where the guests were now arriving thick and fast. Nora had chosen
      her hour well. She entered her father's room, accompanied by Squire
      Murphy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Squire was lying, half-dozing, in his luxurious bed. The fire had
      been recently built up. The room felt close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, dear!" said Squire Murphy, "it is difficult to breathe here! And
      how's yourself, O'Shanaghgan, my man? Why, you do look drawn and pulled
      down. I am right glad to see ye, that I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire of Cronane grasped the hand of the Squire of O'Shanaghgan, and
      the Squire of O'Shanaghgan looked up at the other man's weather-beaten
      face with a pathetic expression in his deep-set, hawk-like, dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am bad, Murphy&mdash;very bad," said the Squire; "it's killing me they
      are amongst them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, it looks like it," said Squire Murphy. "I never was in such a
      smotheration of a place before. Faix, then, why don't you have the window
      open, and have a bit of air circulating through the room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's forbid I am," said the Squire. "Ah, Murphy! it's killing me, it's
      killing me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it shall kill you no longer, father," said Nora. "Oh, father! Squire
      Murphy and I have made up such a lovely, delicious plan. What would you
      say to a big, bare room again, father; and a hard bed again, father; and
      potatoes and a pinch of salt and a little bit of bacon again, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would I say?" cried the Squire. "I'd say, glory be to Heaven, and
      all the Saints be praised; but it is too good luck to be true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it," said Squire Murphy; "it is going to be true. You just
      do what you are bid, and you will be in the hoight of contentment."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wonder-stricken Squire now had to listen to Nora's plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have done it," she cried, in conclusion; "the barn is ready. It makes
      a lovely bedroom; there are no end of draughts, and you'll get well in a
      jiffy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let's be quick," said the Squire, "or your lady-mother will be up
      and prevent me. Hurry, Nora, for Heaven's sake! For the life of me, don't
      give me a cup of cold water to taste, and then dash it from my lips. If we
      are not quick, we'll be caught and prevented from going. I am ready; wrap
      me up in a rug, and carry me out. I am ready and willing. Good-by to
      feather bed-dom. I don't want ever to see these fal-lals again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few moments were ones of intense excitement; but before ten
      minutes had elapsed the Squire was lying in the middle of the hard bed,
      gazing round him with twinkling eyes and a smile on his lips. The
      appearance of Hannah Croneen, with a dish of steaming potatoes and a piece
      of boiled bacon, was the final crown to his rapture.

      CHAPTER XXXII. &mdash; ANDY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Are there any words in the language to describe the scene which took place
      at O'Shanaghgan when Mrs. O'Shanaghgan discovered what Nora had done? She
      called her brother to her aid; and, visiting the barn in her own august
      person, her company dress held neatly up so as to display her trim ankles
      and pretty shoes, solemnly announced that her daughter Nora was guilty of
      the murder of her own father, and that she, Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, washed her
      hands of her in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Nora," said the irate lady, "you can go your own way from this time.
      I have done all that a mother could do for you; but your wildness and
      insubordination are past bearing. This last and final act crowns all. The
      servants shall come into the barn, and bring your poor father back to his
      bedroom, and you shall see nothing of him again until the doctor gives
      leave. Pray, George," continued Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, "send one of the grooms
      at once for Doctor Talbot. I doubt if my poor husband has a chance of
      recovery after this mad deed; but we must take what steps we can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, look here, Ellen," said the Squire; "if you can't be aisy, be as
      aisy as you can. There's no sort of use in your putting on these
      high-falutin airs. I was born an Irishman. I opened my eyes on this world
      in a good, sharp draught, and, if I am to die, it's in a draught I'll
      leave the world; but, once for all, no more smotherations for me. I've had
      too much of 'em. You say this child is likely to be the death of me. Why,
      then, Ellen&mdash;God forgive yer ignorance, my poor wife&mdash;but it's
      the life of me she'll be, not the death. Isn't it in comfort I'm lying for
      the first time since that spalpeen behind the hedge tried to fell me to
      the earth? Isn't it a good meal I've just had?&mdash;potatoes in their
      jackets, and a taste of fat bacon; and if I can wash it down, as I mean to
      later on, with a drop of mountain-dew, why, it's well I'll slumber
      to-night. You're a very fine woman, me lady, and I'm proud as Punch of
      you, but you don't know how to manage a wild Irishman when he is ill. Now,
      Nora, bless her pretty heart, saw right through and through me&mdash;the
      way I was being killed by inches; the hot room and the horrid carpets and
      curtains; and the fire, not even made of decent turf, but those ugly black
      coals, and never a draught through the chamber, except when I took it
      unbeknownst to you. Ah, Nora guessed that her father was dying, and there
      was no way of saving him but doing it on the sly. Well, I'm here, the
      girleen has managed it, and here I'll stay. Not all the doctors in the
      land, nor all the fine English grooms, shall take me back again. I'll walk
      back when I'm fit to walk, and I'll do my best to bear all that awful
      furniture; but in future this is my bedroom, and now you know the worst."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire had a great color in his face as he spoke; his eyes were
      shining as they had not shone since his accident, and his voice was quite
      strong. Squire Murphy, who was standing near, clapped him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Patrick," he said, "it's proud of you I am; you're like your old
      self again&mdash;blest if you're not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora, who was kneeling by her father's bed, kept her face slightly turned
      away from her mother; the tears were in her eyes, but there was a well of
      thanksgiving in her heart. In spite of her mother's angry reproaches, she
      knew she had done the right thing. Her father would get well now. After
      all, his Irish daughter knew what he wanted, and she must bear her English
      mother's anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an incredibly short space of time two or three of the men-servants
      appeared, accompanied by Dr. Talbot. They stood in the entrance to the
      barn, prepared to carry out orders; but now there stole past them the
      Irish groom, Angus, and Hannah Croneen. These two came and stood near Nora
      at the head of the bed. Dr. Talbot examined the patient, looked round the
      cheerless barn, and said, with a smile, glancing from Mrs. O'Shanaghgan to
      O'Shanaghgan's own face:
    </p>
    <p>
      "This will never do; you must get back to your own comfortable room, my
      dear sir&mdash;that is, if I am to continue to attend you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, for God's sake, leave off attending me, Talbot," said the Squire.
      "You must be a rare ignoramus not to see that your treatment is killing me
      out and out. It's fresh air I want, and plenty of it, and no more
      fal-lals. Is it in my grave you'd have me in a fortnight's time? You get
      out of this, and leave me to Mother Nature and the nursing of my Irish
      colleen."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the final straw. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan left the barn, looking more
      erect and more stately even than when she had entered it. Mr. Hartrick
      followed her, so did the enraged Dr. Talbot, and lastly the English
      servants. Squire Murphy uttered the one word, "Routed!" and clapped his
      hand on his thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire, however, spoke sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to vex your lady mother, Nora," he said; "and upon my soul,
      child, you must get me well as quick as possible. We must prove to her
      that we are in the right&mdash;that we must."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a dhrop of the crayther, your honor," said Hannah, now coming
      forward. "It's truth I'm telling, but this is me very last bottle of
      potheen, which I was keeping for me funeral; but there, his honor's
      wilcome to every drain of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pour me out a little," said the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drank off the spirit, which was absolutely pure and unadulterated, and
      smacked his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's fine I'll be to-night," he said; "it's you that have the 'cute ways,
      Nora. You have saved me. But, indeed, I thank you all, my friends, for
      coming to my deliverance."
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, in her smoke-begrimed cabin, Hannah Croneen described with
      much unction the way madam and the English doctor had been made to know
      their place, as she expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Twas himself that put them down," said Hannah. "Ah, but he is a grand
      man, is O'Shanaghgan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan spent a very unhappy night. No comfort could she derive
      even from Mr. Hartrick's words. Nora was an out-and-out rebel, and must be
      treated accordingly; and as to the Squire&mdash;well, when Nora attended
      his funeral her eyes might be opened. The good lady was quite certain that
      the Squire would have developed pneumonia by the morning; but when the
      reports reached her that he looked heartier and better than he had since
      his illness, she could scarcely believe her ears. This, however, was a
      fact, for Mother Nature did step in to cure the Squire; and the draughty
      barn, with its lack of every ordinary comfort, was so soothing to his soul
      that it began to have an equally good effect upon his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding that it poured rain outside, and that great eddies of wind
      came from under the badly-fitting doors and in at the cracks of the small
      windows, the Squire ate his food with appetite, and began once again to
      enjoy life. In the first place, he was no longer lonely. It was impossible
      for his old friends and retainers to visit him in the solitude of his
      grand bedroom; but it was perfectly easy, not only for Squire Murphy and
      Squire Fitzgerald, and half the other squireens of the neighborhood, to
      slip into the barn and have a "collogue," as they expressed it; but also
      the little gossoons in their ragged trousers and bare feet, and the
      girleens, with their curly hair, and roguish dark-blue eyes, to scuttle in
      also. For could they not dart under the bed like so many rabbits if
      madam's step was heard, and didn't the Squire, bless him! like to have
      them with him when madam was busy with her English friends? Then Nora
      herself, the darling of his heart, was scarcely ever away from him now.
      Didn't she sit perched like a bird on the foot of the hard bed and cause
      him to roar with laughter as she described the English and their ways?
      Molly, too, became a prime favorite with the Squire. It is sad to relate
      that he encouraged her in her naughty words, and she began to say
      "Jehoshaphat!" and "Elephants!" and "Holy Moses!" more frequently than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grand fact of all, however, was this: the Squire was getting well
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a week after his removal to the barn Nora was out rather late by
      herself. She had been visiting her favorite haunts by the seashore, and
      was returning laden with seaweeds and shells, when she was startled by
      hearing her name spoken in a low tone just behind her. The sound issued
      from a plantation of thick underwood. The girl paused, and her heart beat
      a little faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. What is it?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment a long and skinny hand and arm were protruded, Nora's own
      arm was forcibly taken possession of, and she was dragged, against her
      will, into the underwood. Her first impulse was to cry out; but being as
      brave a girl as ever walked, she quickly suppressed this inclination, and
      turned and faced the ragged and starved-looking man whom she expected to
      meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Andy, I knew it was you," said Nora. "What do you want with me now?
      How dare you speak to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare I! What do you mane by that, Miss Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know what I mean," answered the girl. "Oh, I have been patient and
      have not said a word; but do you think I did not know? When all the
      country, Andy Neil, were looking for my father's would-be murderer, I knew
      where I could put my hand on him. But I did not say a word. If my father
      had died I must&mdash;I must have spoken; but if he recovered, I felt that
      in me which I cannot describe as pity, but which yet prevented my giving
      you up to the justice you deserve. But to meet me here, to dare to waylay
      me&mdash;it is too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, when you speak like that you near madden me," replied Andy. "Look at
      me, Miss Nora; look well; look hard. Here's the skin tight on me arums,
      and stretched fit to burst over me cheek-bones; and it's empty I am, Miss
      Nora, for not a bite nor sup have I tasted for twenty-four hours. The
      neighbors, they 'as took agen me. It has got whispering abroad that it's
      meself handled the gun that laid the Squire on what might have been his
      deathbed, and they have turned agen me, and not even a pitaty can I get
      from 'em, and I can't get work nowhere; and the roof is took off the
      little bit of a cabin in which I was born, and two of the childers have
      died from cowld and hunger. That's my portion, Miss Nora; that's my bitter
      portion; and yet you ashk me, miss, why I spake to ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know why I said it," answered Nora. "There was a time when I pitied
      you, but not now. You have gone too far; you have done that which no
      daughter can overlook. Let me go&mdash;let me go; don't attempt to touch
      me, or I shall scream out. There are neighbors near who will come to my
      help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, there are not," said Andy. "I 'as took good care of that. You may
      scream as loud as you please, but no one will hear; and if we go farther
      into the underwood no one will see. Come, my purty miss; it's my turn now.
      It's my turn at last. Come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora was strong and fearless, but she had not Andy's brute strength. With
      a clutch, now so fierce and desperate that she wondered her arm was not
      broken, the man, who was half a madman, dragged her deeper into the shade
      of the underwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There now," said Andy, with a chuckle of triumph; "you has got to listen.
      You're the light o' his eyes and the darlin' o' his heart. But what o'
      that? Didn't my childer die of the cowld and the hunger, and the want of a
      roof over them, and didn't I love them? Ah! that I did. Do you remember
      the night I said I'd drown ye in the Banshee's pool, and didn't we make a
      compact that if I let ye go you'd get the Squire to lave me my bit of a
      cabin, and not to evict me? And how did ye kape your word? Ah, my purty,
      how did ye kape your word?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did my best for you," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yer bhest. A poor bhest when I've had to go. But now, Miss Nora, I aint
      waylaid you for nothin'. The masther has escaped this time, and you has
      escaped; but as shure as there is a God in heav'n, if you don't get Squire
      to consint to let me go back, there'll be mischief. There now, Miss Nora,
      I've spoken. You're purty, and you're swate, and 'tis you has got a tinder
      heart; but that won't do you no good, for I'm mad with misery. It's me bit
      of a cabin I want to die in, and nothing less will contint me. You may go
      back now, for I've said what I come to say; but it's to-morrow night I'll
      be here waiting for ye, and I warn ye to bring me the consint that I
      crave, for if you don't come, be the powers! ye'll find that you've played
      with fire when you neglected Andy Neil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having uttered these words, the miserable man dropped Nora's arm and
      vanished into the depths of the plantation. Nora stood still for a moment,
      then returned thoughtfully and slowly to the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. &mdash; THE CABIN ON THE MOUNTAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nora slept little that night. She had a good deal to think of, and very
      anxious were her thoughts. She knew the Irishman, Andy Neil, well, and she
      also knew his ferocious and half-savage temperament. Added to his natural
      fierceness of character, he now undoubtedly was possessed by temporary
      insanity. This had been brought on by hunger, cold, and great misery. The
      man was desperate, and would think little of desperate deeds. After all,
      his life was of small value to him compared to his revenge. Whenever did
      an Irishman, at moments like the present, consider life? Revenge came
      first, and there was that in the man's gleaming dark eyes, in his high
      cheek-bones, in his wild, unkempt, starved appearance, which showed that
      he would, if something was not quickly done, once again attempt the
      Squire's life. What was she to do? Nora wondered and wondered. Her father
      was getting better; the open air treatment, the simple food, and the
      company of his friends were effecting the cure which the luxurious life in
      the heavily furnished chamber had failed to do. The Squire would soon be
      well and strong again. If he were careful, he would once again stand in
      health and strength on his ancestral acres.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would get accustomed to the grandeur of the restored Castle
      O'Shanaghgan; he would get accustomed to his English relatives and their
      ways. He would have his barn to retire to and his friends to talk to, and
      he would still be the darling, the best-loved of all, to his daughter
      Nora; but at the present moment he was in danger. In the barn, too, he was
      in much greater danger than he had been when in the safe seclusion of the
      Castle. It would be possible for any one to creep up to the barn at night,
      to push open the somewhat frail windows or equally frail door, and to
      accomplish that deed which had already been attempted. Nora knew well that
      she must act, she must do something&mdash;what, was the puzzle. Squire
      O'Shanaghgan was one of the most generous, open-hearted, and affectionate
      of men. His generosity was proverbial; he was a prime favorite with his
      tenants; but he had, like many another Irishman of his type, a certain
      hard phase in his character&mdash;he could, on occasions, be almost cruel.
      He had taken a great dislike to Andy Neil and to some other tenants of his
      class; he had been roused to stronger feeling by their open resistance,
      and had declared that not all the Land Leagues in Ireland, not all the
      Fenians, not all the Whiteboys, were they banded together in one great
      insurrection, should frighten him from his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those tenants who defied him, who refused to pay the scanty rent which he
      asked for their humble cabins, should go out; they should, in short, be
      evicted. The other men had submitted to the Squire's iron dictation. They
      had struggled to put their pence and shillings together, and with some
      difficulty had met the question of the rent; but Andy Neil either could
      not or would not pay; and the Squire had got the law, as he expressed it,
      to evict the man. There had come a day when the wild tenant of the little
      cabin on the side of the bare mountain had come home to find his household
      goods exposed to the airs of heaven, the roof off his cabin, the door
      removed from its hinges; the hearth, it is true, still warm with the ashes
      of the sods of turf which were burning there in the morning, but the whole
      home a ruin. The Squire had not himself witnessed this scene of
      desolation, but had given his stern orders, and they had been executed by
      his agent. When Andy saw the ruins of his home he gave one wild howl and
      rushed down the side of the mountain. His sick children&mdash;there were
      two of them in the cabin at the time&mdash;had been taken pity on by some
      neighbors almost as poor as himself; but the shock (or perhaps their own
      bad health) had caused the death of both boys, and the man was now
      homeless and childless. No wonder his brain gave way. He vowed vengeance.
      Vengeance was the one last thing left to him in life; he would revenge his
      wrongs or die. So, waiting his opportunity, he had crouched behind a
      hedge, and, with an old gun which he had stolen from a neighbor, had fired
      at the Squire. In the crucial moment, however, his hand shook, and the
      shot had lodged, not in the Squire's body, but in his leg, causing a nasty
      but scarcely a dangerous wound. The only one in all the world who
      suspected Andy was the Squire's daughter Nora; but it was easy for her to
      put two and two together. The man's words to her in the cave, when he
      threatened to drown her, returned to her memory. She suspected him; but,
      with an Irish girl's sympathy, she would not speak of her suspicions&mdash;that
      is, if her father's life was spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the man himself had come to her and threatened fresh mischief. She
      hated to denounce the poor, starved creature to the police, and yet she <i>must</i>
      protect her father. The Squire was much better; but his temper could be
      roused to great fury at times, and Nora dreaded to mention the subject of
      Andy Neil. She guessed only too well that fear would not influence the
      fierce old Squire to give the man back his cabin. The one thing the
      wretched creature now craved was to die under the shelter of the roof
      where he had first seen the light; but this natural request, so dear to
      the heart of the Squire himself, under altered circumstances, would not
      weigh with him under existing conditions. The mere fact that Andy still
      threatened him would make him more determined than ever to stick to his
      purpose. Nora did not dare to give her father even a hint with regard to
      the hand which had fired that shot; and yet, and yet&mdash;oh, God help
      her! she must do something, or the consequences might be too fearful to
      contemplate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was dressing on the following morning she thought hard, and the
      idea came to her to take the matter into her own hands, and herself give
      Andy leave to go back to his cabin; but, on reflection, she found that
      this would be no easy matter, for the cabins from which the tenants were
      evicted were often guarded by men whose business it was to prevent the
      wretched creatures returning to them. No doubt Andy's cabin would be now
      inaccessible; still, she might go and look at it, and, if all other means
      failed, might venture to beg of her father's agent to let the man return
      to it; but first of all she would see the place. Somewhat cheered as this
      determination came to her, she ran downstairs. Mr. Hartrick was returning
      to England by an early train, and the carriage, which was to convey him to
      the station, was already at the door. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan was almost tearful
      at the thought of parting with her beloved brother. Molly, delighted at
      being allowed to stay on at the Castle, was also present; but Nora's
      entrance on the scene caused Mrs. O'Shanaghgan to speak fretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Late as usual, Nora," said that lady, turning and facing her daughter as
      she appeared. "I am glad that you condescended to appear before your uncle
      starts for England. I wonder that you have taken the trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do not scold her, Ellen," said Mr. Hartrick, kindly. "I begin to
      understand something of the nature of my Irish niece. When the Squire is
      well again she will, I am sure, return to England and resume her studies;
      but at present we can scarcely expect her to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will come back some time, Uncle George," said Nora; "and oh!" she
      added, "I do thank you for all your great and real kindness. I may appear
      ungrateful, but indeed, indeed I am not so in my heart, and it is very
      good of you to allow Molly to stay; and I will promise to take great care
      of her, and not to let her get too wild."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. Any message for your aunt, Nora?" said Mr. Hartrick gravely.
      "I should like you, my dear," he added, coming up to the girl, and laying
      his hand on her shoulder and looking with his kind eyes into her face, "to
      send your Aunt Grace a very special message; for you did try her terribly,
      Nora, when you not only ran away yourself, but induced Molly to accompany
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora hesitated for a moment, the color flamed into her face, and her eyes
      grew very bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell her, Uncle George," she said, speaking slowly and with great
      emphasis, "that I did what I did for <i>father</i>. Tell her that for no
      one else but father would I hurt her, and ask her to forgive me just
      because I am an Irish girl; and I love&mdash;oh! I love my father so
      dearly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will take her your message, my dear," said Mr. Hartrick, and then he
      stooped and kissed his niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he was about to step into the carriage, when Nora rushed up
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by; God bless you!" she cried. "Oh, how kind you have been, and how
      I love you! Please, please, do not misunderstand me; I have many cares and
      anxieties at present or I would say more. You have done splendidly, only&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only what, Nora?" said her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only, Uncle George," answered the girl, "you have done what you have done
      to please my mother, and you have done it all in the English way; and oh!
      the English way is very fine, and very noble, and very generous; but&mdash;but
      we <i>did</i> want the old bare rooms and the lack of furniture, and the
      place as it always has been; but we could not expect&mdash;I mean father
      and I could not expect&mdash;you and mother to remember that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was impossible, Nora," said her uncle. "What I did I did, as you
      express it, my dear, in the English way. The retrograde movement, Nora,
      could not be expected from an Englishman; and by-and-by you, at least,
      will thank me for having brought civilization to O'Shanaghgan."
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Mr. Hartrick went away, and Nora returned to the house.
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan had left the room, and Nora found herself alone with her
      cousin Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Nora?" said Molly. "You look quite pale and anxious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I look what I feel," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can I help you in any way, Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Will you come for a drive with me this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I will. You know well that I should like nothing better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Molly dear, run round to the yard and tell Angus put Black Bess to
      the outside car, and to bring it round to the corner of the plantation. I
      do not want any one to know, and tell Angus that I will drive Black Bess
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," replied Molly, running off on her errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora did not stay long with her father that morning, and soon after ten
      o'clock she and Molly were flying through the boreens and winding roads in
      the direction of Slieve Nagorna. At the foot of the mountain they
      dismounted. Nora fastened Black Bess's reins to the trunk of a tree which
      stood near, and then she and Molly began to ascend the mountain. It was a
      glorious winter's day; the air was mild, as it generally is in the west of
      Ireland, and the sun shone with power. Nora and Molly walked quickly.
      Nora, who was accustomed to climbing from her earliest years, scaled the
      rocks, and jumped from one tiny projection in the ground to another; but
      Molly found her ascent more difficult. She was soon out of breath, and
      called in laughing tones to Nora to wait for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me," said Nora; "I sometimes forget that you are not an Irish
      girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You also forget that I am practically a London girl," answered Molly. "I
      have seldom or never climbed even a respectable hill, far less a mountain
      with sides like this one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will reach the spot which I am aiming for before long," said Nora;
      "but if you are tired, do sit down, and I'll go on alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, Molly would not hear of, and presently the girls reached a
      spot where once a small cabin had stood. The walls of the cabin were still
      there, but the thatched roof had disappeared, the doors and windows had
      been removed, and the blackened earth where the hearth had been alone bore
      evidence to the fact that fires had been burnt there for long generations.
      But there was no fire now on the desolate hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear!" said Nora. "It makes me cry to look at the place. Once, long,
      long ago, when Terry and I were tiny children, we came up here. Andy's
      wife was alive then, and she gave us a hot potato each and a pinch of
      salt. We ate the potatoes just here, and how good they tasted! Little Mike
      was a baby, such a pretty little boy, and dear Kathleen was so proud of
      him. Oh! it was a <i>home</i> then, whereas now it is a desolation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very poor sort of home I should say," answered Molly. "What a truly
      desolate place! If anybody ever lived here, that person must be glad to
      have got away. It makes me shudder even to think of any human being
      calling this spot a home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" answered Nora, "it was a very pretty home, and the one who lived in
      it is broken-hearted&mdash;nay, more, he is almost crazed, all and
      entirely because he has been driven away. He deserved it, I know; but it
      has gone very hard with him; it has torn out his heart; it has turned him
      from a man into a savage. Oh! if I had only money, would not I build up
      these walls, and put back the roof, and light the fire once more, and put
      the man who used to have this house as a home back again? He would die in
      peace then. Oh! if only, <i>only</i> I had money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How queer you look!" said Molly. "How your eyes shine! I don't understand
      you. I love you very much, but I confess I don't understand you. Why, this
      desolate spot would drive most people mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not Irish people who were born here," said Nora. "There! I have seen
      what I wanted to see, and we had best be going back. I want to drive to
      the village, and I want to see John Finnigan. I hope I shall find him at
      home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is John Finnigan?" asked Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man who <i>does</i> these sort of things," said Nora, the red, angry
      blood rushing to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and quickly walked down the mountain, Molly racing and
      stumbling after her. Black Bess was standing motionless where her mistress
      had placed her. Nora unfastened the reins and sprang upon the car, Molly
      followed her example, and they drove almost on the wings of the wind back
      to the village. There they were fortunate enough to find John Finnigan.
      Leaving Molly holding Black Bess's reins, Nora went into the house. It was
      a very small and shabby house, furnished in Irish style, and presided over
      by Mrs. Finnigan, a very stout, untidy, and typical Irishwoman, with all
      the good nature and <i>savoir-faire</i> of her countrywomen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, then, Miss Nora," she said, "I am glad to see you. And how's the
      Squire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much better, thank you," said Nora. "Is your husband in, Mrs. Finnigan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, deary. Finnigan's abed still. He was out late last night.
      Why, listen; you can hear him snoring; the partition is thin. He snores
      loud enough to be heard all over the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, do wake him, please, Mrs. Finnigan," said Nora. "I want to see him
      on a most important matter at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, that being the case, honey, you just step into the parlor while I
      go and get Finnigan to rise and dress himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Finnigan threw open the door of a very untidy and small room. Several
      children were having breakfast by a table which bore traces of fish-bones,
      potato-peelings, and bacon-rinds. The children were untidy, like their
      mother, but had the bright, very dark-blue eyes and curly hair of their
      country. Nora knew them all, and was soon in the midst of a clamorous
      group, while Mrs. Finnigan went out to get her husband to rise. Finnigan
      himself appeared in about a quarter of an hour, and Nora went with him
      into his little study.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now," said that worthy, "and what can I do for you, Miss
      O'Shanaghgan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora looked very earnest and pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father is better," she said, "but not well enough yet to be troubled
      with business. I understand that you are doing some of his business for
      him, Mr. Finnigan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some, it is true," answered the gentleman, frowning as he spoke, "but not
      all, by no means all. Since that English fine gentleman, Mr. Hartrick,
      came over, he has put the bulk of the property into the hands of Steward
      of Glen Lee. Steward is a Scotchman, and why he should get work which is
      rightly my due is hard on me, Miss Nora&mdash;very hard on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Nora restlessly, "I know nothing about the matter. I am
      sorry; but I am afraid I am powerless to interfere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss Nora!" said Finnigan, "you know very well that you have kissed
      the Blarney Stone, and that no one can resist you. If you were to say a
      word to the Squire he would give me my due; and now that so much money has
      been put into O'Shanaghgan, it would be a very fine thing for me to have
      the collecting of the rents. I am a poor man, Miss Nora, and this business
      ought not to be given over my head to a stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will speak to father by-and-by," said Nora; "but I doubt if I can do
      anything. But I have come to-day to ask you to do something for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is that, Miss Nora? I am sure I'd be proud to help such a
      beautiful young lady in any way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dislike compliments," said Nora, coloring with annoyance. "Please
      listen. You know the man you evicted from the cabin on the side of Slieve
      Nagorna&mdash;Andy Neil?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly well, perfectly well," answered Finnigan,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had my father's orders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had that, Miss Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you, Mr. Finnigan, now to take my orders and to give Andy back his
      cabin. Put a bit of roof over it&mdash;anything, even an old tarpaulin&mdash;anything,
      so that he may sleep there if he likes to-night. I want you to do this for
      me, and allow me to take the risk of offending my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" said Finnigan, "and risk myself all chance of getting the agency.
      No, no, Miss Nora. Besides, what would all the other tenants say who have
      been evicted in their time? The man shall get his cabin back and a fresh
      roof and new windows, by the same token, when he pays his rent, and not
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he has no money to pay his rent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he must stay out, Miss Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish, I wish," said Nora, clasping her hands and speaking with passion,
      "that you would oblige me in this. Indeed, it is of the utmost
      importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" said Finnigan, going up to her and staring into her face; "has
      that scoundrel threatened? Is it possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no; you are mistaken," said Nora eagerly. "I only meant that I&mdash;I&mdash;pitied
      him so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That being the case, Miss Nora, I will say nothing further. But the fact
      is, I have before had my suspicions as to the hand which pulled that
      trigger which sent the shot into the Squire's leg, and it would be an
      extremely graceful act on my part to have that person arrested, and would
      doubtless insure the agency for me. But I will say no more; only, please
      understand, under <i>no</i> circumstances, except the payment of the rent,
      can Andy Neil get back his cabin."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. &mdash; A DARING DEED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Having failed to get any help from John Finnigan, Nora returned to the
      Castle. As she drove quickly home she was very silent. Even loquacious
      Molly did not care to interrupt her thoughts. As soon as they reached the
      Castle she turned to her cousin and spoke quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to the barn and look after father, Molly. Talk as many naughty words
      as ever you like; make him laugh; keep him occupied. After dinner I shall
      probably want your aid again. In the meantime you will help me best by
      taking father off my hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I desire nothing better," answered Molly. "I love the Squire; it is
      the height of entertainment, as he would call it, to talk to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly accordingly ran off. The Squire was now well enough to sit up in a
      great easy-chair made of straw, which had been carted over from Cronane
      for his special benefit, for the padded and velvet-covered chairs of the
      Castle would not at all have suited his inclinations. He sat back in the
      depths of his chair, which creaked at his every movement, and laughed long
      and often at Molly's stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where's Light o' the Morning herself?" he said after a pause. "Why
      don't she come to visit her old father? Why, it's craving for a sight of
      her I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Nora is very busy to-day," answered Molly, "May I read the paper
      to you, Squire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You read the paper to me?" answered Squire O'Shanaghgan. "Why, bless yer
      little heart, my pretty girleen, but I must decline with thanks. It is
      perfect torture to listen to your English accent when you are trying to do
      the rich Irish brogue. Irish papers should be read by Irish colleens, and
      then you get the flavor. But what did you say my colleen was after&mdash;business,
      is it? She's very fond of poking that little finger of hers into other
      people's pies. What is she after now at all, at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell you," answered Molly, coloring slightly as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire looked annoyed and suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go and call her to me," he said. "Tell her to come along this blessed
      minute; say it's wanting her I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly ran out of the barn. She found Nora in earnest conversation with
      Angus, while Hannah Croneen stood close by plucking now and then at the
      girl's skirt, looking eagerly into her face, and uttering such
      ejaculations as "Oh, glory!" "Be the powers!" "Did ye ever hear the like?"
      "Well, well, that beats all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora," said Molly, "will you go to your father? He wants you
      immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you let out anything?" said Nora, turning and looking anxiously at
      Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but he asked after you, and I said you were busy. The Squire said
      then, 'I hope she is not poking her little finger into other people's
      pies.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I will go to him," said Nora. "I'll manage him. You stay where you
      are, Molly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora's black hair was curling in crisp waves all round her beautiful white
      forehead. Her dark-blue eyes were darker and more shining than ever, there
      was a richer bloom on her cheeks, and there were sweeter smiles on her
      lips than she had ever perhaps worn before as she now entered the Squire's
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, father?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire O'Shanaghgan, who had been sitting wrapped in thought, roused
      himself on her entrance, gave her a smile, and motioned her to come to his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kneel down by me, colleen," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora knelt. The Squire took his big hand and put it under her chin; he
      raised her blooming face and looked into her eyes, which looked back again
      at him. As he did so he uttered a quick sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're after something, mavoureen," he said. "What's up, little girl?
      What's fretting that tender heart of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something, father," said Nora then.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you won't tell your old dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather not. Won't you trust me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust her, is it?" cried the Squire. "I'd trust her with all I possess.
      I'd trust her with my hopes of heaven itself. Trust her, is it? Nora, you
      fret me when you talk like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then <i>do</i> trust me, father, and don't ask me any questions. I'll
      tell you by and by&mdash;yes, I faithfully promise, but I shall be busy
      to-day. I may have to be away from you for a great part of to-day, and I
      may want Molly to help me. Can you do without me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, now, the conceit of the creature," said the Squire. "As if I cannot
      do without you, you little piece of impertinence. To be sure, and to be
      sure I can. Why, there is your lady mother; she'll come and sit with me
      for an hour or so, and let out at me all her grumbles. Nora, my heart, it
      is dreadful to hear her; but it's good penance too, and maybe it's too
      comfortable you have been making me, and I ought to have a bit of what I
      do not like to keep me humble. You go along now, and come back when you
      have done that which is filling your heart to the brim."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora kissed her father very gravely; she then went out of the barn, and
      returned to where Angus and Hannah, and also Molly, were waiting for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have thought how I can manage, Miss Nora," said Angus. "When those
      Englishmen&mdash;bad cess to 'em!&mdash;are at dinner I'll get the long
      cart out of the yard, and I'll put the white pony to it, and then it's
      easy to get the big tarpaulin that we have for the hayrick out of its
      place in the west barn. I have everything handy; and if you could come
      along with me, Miss Nora, and the other young lady, and if Hannah here
      will lend a hand, why we'll do up the place a bit, and the poor forsaken
      crayther can die there at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not forget the basket of provisions, Hannah," said Nora, "the
      potatoes, and the bacon, and a tiny bottle of potheen; and do not forget
      some fagots and bits of turf to kindle up the fire again. Oh, and, Hannah,
      a blanket if you can manage it; and we might get a few wisps of straw to
      put in the bottom of the cart. The straw would make a fine bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure," said Hannah. "You lave it to me, me beautiful young lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two servants now departed, and Nora and her cousin went into the
      house. The early dinner, or rather lunch, as it was now called, was served
      soon afterwards; and almost immediately after the meal was over Nora and
      Molly ran down to the bottom of the plantation, where they found Angus,
      Hannah, the long cart with the pony harnessed to it, and the tarpaulin,
      straw, basket of provisions, etc., all placed in the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jump in, Molly," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly scrambled in as best she could; Nora followed her; and Hannah,
      climbing in over the left wheel, sat down at the bottom of the cart. Angus
      jumped on the driver's seat, and whipped up the pony. The pony was stout
      and very strong, and well accustomed to Irish hills. They were off. Molly
      had never been so rattled and bumped and shaken in the whole course of her
      life, but she enjoyed it, as she said, immensely. Only, what was Nora
      doing? The tarpaulin had been carefully hidden from view by the straw
      which Angus had cunningly placed over and not under it; and it was well
      that this was the case, as after the little party had left O'Shanaghgan a
      couple of miles, they were met by John Finnigan driving on his outside
      car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, Miss Nora, what are you doing now?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Having a drive for my own pleasure," replied Nora, nodding gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finnigan looked with suspicion at the party, but as there was nothing
      contraband in anybody driving in a long cart, and as he could not possibly
      guess what they were doing, he drove on his own way without saying
      anything further. After less than an hour's driving they reached the foot
      of Slieve Nagorna, and here the real toil began, for it was quite
      impossible for the pony, willing as he was, to lug the cart up the
      mountain. Where there is a will, however, there is generally a way; and
      although the pony could not drag the cart up, he could go up himself,
      being very sure-footed and quite willing to be turned into a beast of
      burden for the nonce. The heavy tarpaulin, therefore, was fastened on his
      back, and, with Angus leading and Hannah following with the basket of
      provisions, and the two girls making up the rear, the little cavalcade
      started forward. Oh, how hot it seemed, and oh, how tired Molly got! But
      never mind; they were making progress. After a time they reached the site
      of Andy's cabin, and then Angus and Hannah developed strength which fairly
      took Molly's breath away, for the tarpaulin was absolutely lifted up and
      deposited as a sort of temporary roof over the roofless walls; and when
      this had been done Angus managed to cut a hole in the center to make a
      chimney; then the fagots were placed on the hearth and the turf put on top
      of them, and the remainder of the turf laid handy near by; and the straw
      was ready, soft and inviting, in a corner not too far away from the fire,
      and the blankets were spread over it; and the basket of provisions, cold
      boiled potatoes, cold bacon, and the little bottle of potheen were all
      left handy. It was indeed a miserable home, but, compared to the desolate
      appearance it had presented, it now looked almost comfortable. Nora
      laughed with pleasure. "He shall come back here. It is better than
      nothing. He shall stop here. I will explain things to my father by and
      by," said the girl; and then they all turned their steps homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed hour that evening Nora went down to the shore. She fully
      expected to find Andy Neil waiting for her. Wild and half-insane as he
      was, he kept his selfmade appointments, as a rule. She wandered about,
      fearing that someone would notice her; for she knew that if John Finnigan
      thought for a single moment that she was secretly befriending Andy, he
      would not leave a single stone unturned to circumvent her. He was very
      proud of his powers of evicting tenants, and, as he had the Squire's
      permission to do his worst on this occasion, would be the last man in the
      world to relax his iron grip. Nora, however, wandered about in vain; there
      was no sign of Andy. She even ventured to go to the borders of the
      plantation and softly call his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andy&mdash;Andy Neil," called the girl, but no Andy responded. She now
      felt really nervous. Why was Andy not there? What could possibly have
      happened? She returned slowly and thoughtfully to the house. It would not
      do to show any alarm, but she certainly felt the reverse of comfortable.
      What had happened to the man? She did not for a moment think that he could
      be dead; on the contrary, she pictured him alive and still more insane
      than the night before, still more desperate in his mind, still more darkly
      pursued by the grim phantom of revenge. Was Andy now so really insane that
      he had even forgotten his appointment with Nora? This was probably the
      case. But although the man was too insane to think of meeting the girl, he
      was probably not at all too insane to make another attempt on the Squire's
      life. He was perhaps so desperate now that his one idea was to carry out
      his revenge before he died. What was Nora to do? She thought and thought,
      and walked up to the house with more and more lagging footsteps. Finally
      she made up her mind. There was nothing whatever left for it but for her
      to sit up with the Squire that night; she herself must be his guardian
      angel, for he must not be alarmed, and yet most certainly he must be
      protected. Nora carefully considered this idea. She had made the little
      cabin quite ready for Andy's reception; he could creep into it once more,
      light his fire, eat his food, and lie down on the bed at least, as good as
      any other bed he had ever slumbered on; and if death came to him, it would
      find him in his old house, and perhaps God would forgive him, seeing that
      he was so desperate and life had been so hard. Yes, Nora felt that God was
      very merciful&mdash;far more merciful than man. But to-night&mdash;how was
      to-night to be got through? She had now reached the yard, and found
      herself face to face with Angus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there nothing I can do for you, miss?" said the young man, touching
      his hat respectfully to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you could be near somewhere, Angus, and if it were necessary, and we
      wanted the long cart to-night, could we get it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ask me, Miss Nora, what we could get and what we could not get at
      O'Shanaghgan," answered Angus; "and I answer ye back that what ye want,
      Miss Nora, ye shall have, if it is the heart out of me body. The long
      cart, is it? To be sure, me pretty lady, and at a moment's notice, too.
      Why, it's meself will slape in the bottom of the long cart this blessed
      night, and all you has to do is to come and pull the front lock of me
      hair, and I'll be up in a jiffy. You give it a sharp tug, Miss Nora, for I
      slapes heavy; but if you come, the long cart and the powny will be there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then that's all right," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went into the barn. The Squire had now contrived to renew all his old
      accustomed habits. On the little wooden table was a small lamp which
      smoked badly; the local paper was laid on the table, and the pipe which
      the Squire best loved lay near. He had been enjoying a good smoke, and was
      thinking of turning in, as he expressed it, when Nora appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, father," she said. She went up to him, and bent down over
      him, to give him her accustomed kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, it's sleepy I am," said the Squire. "I am thinking of turning
      into bed. I am getting on fine; and Angus, boy that he is, always comes
      and gives me a helping hand on to my bed. I cannot see your face with the
      smoke of that lamp, mavoureen; but things are all right&mdash;aren't
      they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That they are, father," replied the girl; "but I am a little tired; and
      if Angus is coming to help you, and you do not want anything more from me,
      I will go to bed myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do that," said the Squire. "Your voice sounds peaky; you have been doing
      too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora lingered another moment or two. How thankful she felt that that smoky
      lamp prevented her father reading the anxiety in her eyes! She could not
      keep all the tiredness out of her voice, but she could at least keep
      anxiety from it; and the Squire bade her a hearty goodnight, and parted
      with her with one of his usual jokes. Nora then went into the house. The
      hour for late dinner was over; she herself had not been present, but Molly
      had managed to appear as usual. Nora ran down to the kitchen premises. The
      cook, a very stately English woman, stared when she saw the young lady of
      the Castle appear in the great kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Miss O'Shanaghgan?" she said, gazing at Nora all over. What
      did this wild and eccentric girl want? How was it possible that she could
      demean herself by coming so freely into the servants' premises?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to know, Mrs. Shaw," said Nora, "if you will oblige me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I will, Miss O'Shanaghgan; if I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you pack a little basket with some cold pie, and anything else tasty
      and nourishing which you have got; and will you put a tiny bottle of
      brandy into the basket, and also a bottle of water; and can I have it at
      once, for I am in a great hurry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there is a fresh pigeon pie in the larder," answered the cook; "but
      why should you want it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! please, Mrs. Shaw," answered Nora, "will you give it to me without
      asking questions? I will love you for all the rest of my life if you
      will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love me, is it?" thought the cook. "A pretty creature like that love me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your love is cheaply purchased, miss," she said aloud, and then went
      without a word into the larder, and soon returned with a well-filled
      basket, which she placed in Nora's hand. "And I added some fruit, a little
      cup of jelly, and a knife and fork and a spoon, and some salt; but why
      you, Miss Nora, should need a picnic in the middle of the night beats me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember our compact," said Nora. "You say nothing of this, and&mdash;I
      love you;" and then, overcome by a sudden impulse, she bent forward and
      laid the lightest of kisses on the astonished Mrs. Shaw's forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Shaw felt slightly overawed. "Bless her! What a beautiful young lady
      she is!" thought the good woman. "But the ways of the Irish beat all
      comprehension."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. &mdash; THE COT WHERE HE WAS BORN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nora avoided Molly that night. On reflection, it occurred to her that it
      would be best for Molly to know nothing of her design. If she were in
      complete ignorance, no amount of questioning could elicit the truth. Nora
      went into her bedroom, and changed her pretty jacket and skirt and neat
      sailor hat for a dark-blue skirt and blouse of the same material. Over
      these she put a long, old-fashioned cloak which at one time had belonged
      to her mother. Over her head she tied a little red handkerchief, and,
      having eaten a small portion of Mrs. Shaw's provisions, she left the room.
      It was already night-time; and Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, Molly, and the servants
      had gone to bed. Nora now locked her door from the outside, slipped the
      key into her pocket, and her basket of provisions partly hidden under the
      falls of her cloak, ran downstairs. The dogs generally slept in the big
      hall; but they knew Nora's step, and rose slowly, wagging their heavy
      tails. Nora patted them on their heads, gave them each an endearing word,
      and stooped to kiss pretty Cushla on her black forehead. She then softly
      unbolted one of the windows, lifted the sash, and got out. She carefully
      shut the window as noiselessly as she had opened it. She now found herself
      on the grassy sward in the neighborhood of the drawing-room. Under the old
      <i>régime</i> that sward was hard, and knotty tufts of weed as well as
      grass grew up here and there in profusion; but already, under the English
      government, it was beginning to assume the velvet-like appearance which a
      properly kept lawn ought to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora hated to feel such softness; she disliked everything which seemed to
      her to flavor of the English and their ways. There was a hot, rebellious
      feeling in her heart. Why should these things be? Why should not her Irish
      land and her Irish people be left in their wild freedom? She ran round to
      the yard. Angus had received instructions to leave the little postern door
      on the latch, and Nora now opened it and went softly in. The moon was
      beginning to rise, but was not at the full. There was, however already
      sufficient light for her to see each object with distinctness. She went
      and sat down in the shadow made by the great barn. She sat on the step to
      the barn, wrapping her warm cloak tightly round her, and keeping her
      basket of provisions by her side. Here she would sit all night, if
      necessary. Her vigil might have no result, but at any rate it would insure
      her father from danger. For now only over Nora's dead body could the wild
      Andy Neil approach the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andy shall kill me first," she thought; "and if I die, I will scream and
      father will awaken. Angus is on the watch; the alarm will be given; at
      least my father's life will be spared. But why do I think of danger of
      this sort? Andy will not kill me. I place my trust in God. I am doing the
      right thing&mdash;I know I am doing the right thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Nora had let herself in at the postern door she had immediately drawn
      the bolt at the other side, thus preventing anyone else from entering the
      great yard by the same way; but she knew that, although Andy could not now
      enter the yard, in all probability he was already hiding there. There were
      no end to the ways and devices of a wild Irishman of Andy's sort. He was
      so thin and emaciated, too, that he could squeeze himself into the tiniest
      space. It lay in his power to remain motionless all night, until the
      moment when his revenge was ripe. Nora sat on. She heard the old clock in
      the ancient tower of the Castle strike the hours. That old clock had been
      severely animadverted on by Mrs. O'Shanaghgan on account of the cracked
      sound in the bell; but Nora felt relieved to find that, amongst all the
      modern innovations, the old clock still held its own; it had not, at
      least, <i>yet</i>, been removed from the tower. It struck solemnly now the
      hour of midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The witching hour," thought the girl. "The hour when the Banshee walks
      abroad. I wonder if I shall see her. I should like to see her. Did she
      hear me when I called to her in the cave? Would she help me if she came to
      my rescue now? She belongs to us; she is our own Banshee; she has belonged
      to our family for many, many generations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora thought these thoughts; but then the feeling that <i>Someone</i> else
      who never fails those who trust Him was also watching her during this
      silent hour came to her with a sense of comfort. She could hear her father
      turning once or twice in the creaky old wooden bed. She was glad to feel
      that, unknown to him, she was his guardian angel. She began to think about
      the future, and almost to forget Andy and the possible and very great
      peril of the present, when, shortly before the hour of one, all her senses
      were preternaturally excited by the sound of a footfall. It was a very
      soft footfall&mdash;the noise made by a bare foot. Nora heard it just
      where the shadow was deepest. She stood up now; she knew that, from her
      present position, the one who was making this dead sort of heavy sound
      could not possibly see her. She waited, her breath coming hard and fast.
      For a minute, or perhaps more, there was again absolute and complete
      silence. The night was a breathless one; there was not a sound abroad;
      overhead the sky was of an inky blue-black, the stars were shining
      gloriously, and the moon was growing brighter and more clear, and more
      nearly approaching her meridian each moment. The girl stood with her hand
      pressed against her beating heart; she had flung aside her little red
      handkerchief, and her hair had fallen loose and was tumbling over her
      shoulders; she raised her other hand to her left ear to listen more
      intently&mdash;she was in the attitude of one about to spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there came the sound which she expected, and which, now that it had
      arrived, caused her heart to beat no longer with fear, but with a sort of
      wild exultation. Her suspicions had been right&mdash;the danger was real;
      her father's most precious life was in peril. The steps came quicker and
      more quick; they approached the other window of the barn. This window lay
      in complete shadow. Nora now stepped out of her hiding place, and, going
      with two or three quick strides down the yard, waited within a foot or two
      of the man, who now proceeded to lift himself up by the window ledge
      preparatory to opening the barn window. With the aid of a claspknife he
      could very easily push back the quaint and imperfect fastening; then it
      was but to push in the glass, and he could enter the barn. He sat on the
      window ledge with his back to Nora. His huge, gaunt form looked larger
      than ever, intensified now by the light of the moon. He breathed quickly;
      his breathing proclaimed that he himself was in physical suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andy," said Nora in a low, very low whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this low tone was as startling to the madman on the window as though a
      pistol shot had been sounded in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be the powers!" he said, and he tumbled so quickly off the window sill
      that Nora herself held out her hand to help him. Then he turned fiercely
      and faced the girl. She saw the light of madness gleaming in his sunken
      eyes; his wild face looked more cadaverous than ever; his great, skinny,
      long hand shook. He raised it as if to fell the girl to the ground, but
      paused to look in her face, and then his hand hung feebly to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora had enacted all this scene beforehand to herself; she now thrust into
      Andy's face, within an inch or two of his nose, a great lump of bread and
      a slab of cold pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before you do anything more, eat," she said; "eat quickly; make no
      noise."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as impossible for the famished man to resist the good and tempting
      food as it would have been impossible for a needle to resist the influence
      of a powerful magnet. He grasped the bread, thrust the knife into his
      wretched shirt, and, tearing the bread in fragments, began to stuff it
      into his mouth. For a couple of minutes there was no sound but that of the
      starved creature tearing the bread and feeding himself. When he had
      slightly satisfied the first cravings of his starved body Nora took his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have not had enough yet," she said. "You have fasted long, and are
      very hungry; there is more where this came from."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took his hand quite unresistingly, and led him round to the entrance
      of the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am up," she said, "but no one else. No one else knows of this. You have
      come without a gun?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a knife instead," he said. His eye glittered strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me your knife," said the girl. "I will give you food in exchange for
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The famished creature began to gibber now in the most horrible manner; he
      pointed to his breast and uttered a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Laugh again, and I will call those who will soon put a stop to your wild
      and terrible purposes, Andy," said the girl, "Here's food&mdash;fruit,
      jelly, bread. You shall have them all&mdash;all, when you give me that
      knife."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at the food, and now his eyes softened. They became full
      not only of rapture, but also of laughter. He gave a low guttural sound,
      sank down on the ground, and held out both his hands imploringly for some
      of the nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The knife," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust his hands into his bosom and held the knife out to her. It was a
      huge clasp knife, and Nora noticed with a shudder that it had all the
      appearance of having been newly sharpened. The moment she got it she put
      it in her pocket, and then invited the man to feed. He sat now quite
      humbly. Nora helped him to pie. She had already taken the precaution to
      hide the knife which Mrs. Shaw had supplied her with. The man ate and ate,
      until his consuming hunger was satisfied. Nora now gave him a very little
      of the brandy mixed with water. He lay back at last, exhausted and also
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's wake I am, it's wake I am&mdash;it's wake I am entoirely," said he.
      "Why are you so good to me, Miss Nora? It was to take the life of the
      Squire I was afther to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew that," said Nora, "and I thought I would prevent you. Why did you
      not meet me this evening down by the shore?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The miserable creature now raised his hand and pushed back a gray lock of
      unkempt hair from his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then," he said, "it was bothered I was entoirely. I knew there was
      something I had got to do. It was waker and waker I was getting, for I did
      not touch bite nor sup since I saw you last, except a morsel of a cold
      pitatie; and there was not much of the nourishment in that; and as the
      night came, I could not think of anything except to keep me word and have
      me victory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you have had it," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mane now, missie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have conquered yourself; that is the best victory of all. But come,
      you made a bargain with me last night, and I am prepared to keep it. I
      went down to the shore to tell you that I would do what you wanted me to
      do. The cabin is ready on Slieve Nagorna; we have made it fairly
      comfortable for you; and I will do better&mdash;yes, I will try to do
      better by and by. I will speak to my father when he is strong enough. Go
      to Slieve Nagorna now, and you will find the old cot in which you were
      born. You can sleep there, and&mdash;and <i>I</i>&mdash;I will see that
      you are not interfered with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old cot in which I was born," said Neil very slowly. "The old cot,
      and I'll see it again. Is it a-joking me you are, Miss Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would I joke with you just now, Andy? Would I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it's saft you are making me. There was a lump of ice in me; but,
      somehow, it's melted. It's the food and your bonny face, and yer ways. But
      do you know that it was your <i>father</i> I wanted to kill&mdash;t'ould
      Squire? There, I have said it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know&mdash;and I have saved him," answered Nora. "But come, he may hear
      us speaking; he would wonder. I do not want him to know anything of this
      night. When he is stronger I will plead with him. Come, Andy, come; your
      home is ready for you. Go back to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man tottered to his feet, and began to stagger across the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay! you are not strong enough," said the girl. "Come outside the yard,
      here; come with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked across the yard, reached the little postern gate, and opened
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come out and wait," she said in a mysterious voice. "You cannot walk to
      Slieve Nagorna, and yet you must get there; but I will get Angus to take
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angus! ay, he is a true Irish boy. Aw, I'd trust him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You well may; he is a broth of a boy," said Nora. "Sit there. I will soon
      be back with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut Andy out, bolting the little gate. The man heard the bolt being
      drawn, but did not move; he had not the slightest fear but that Nora would
      keep her word. She ran across the yard and opened the door of the barn at
      the farther end. Angus was already awake; he heard her light step.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it me you're wanting, Miss Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angus, all is well," she said. "What I wanted to do I have succeeded in
      doing. It is Andy Neil who is without; he is broken down and is very weak.
      Get the long cart and take him to the foot of Slieve Nagorna, help him up
      the mountain, and see him into the old cot where he was born. Good-night,
      Angus, and God bless you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora returned to her own bedroom. She unlocked the door and let herself
      in. Without waiting even to undress, she flung herself on the bed, curled
      herself up, and went off into dreamless slumber. When she woke again it
      was broad daylight, and Molly was standing over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Nora, you have lain undressed all night! What&mdash;what has
      happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not ask me," said Nora. "Do not ask me. I have done what I wanted to
      do, and I am thankful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you won't really tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I won't. I cannot ever. There is more to attend to, Molly; you and I
      have got to go to Slieve Nagorna immediately after breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly did not ask anything further.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I brought your hot water," she said. "You do not want any of the grand
      English servants to see you look like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a dear old thing you are!" said Nora. "I am so grateful to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up, took off her clothes, indulged in a hot bath, and came down to
      breakfast looking exactly as if she had spent an ordinary night. Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan was a little more fretful than ever, and told Nora that her
      conduct was making her mother quite ridiculous in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I met those remarkably nice people, the Setons of Seton Court,
      yesterday," said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan&mdash;"charming English people&mdash;and
      they asked me if it was really true that my husband, the owner of Castle
      O'Shanaghgan, was sleeping in a barn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did you answer, mother?" asked Nora, her dark-blue eyes bright
      with sudden fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, I made the best of it. I could not deny such a patent
      fact. I said that the eccentricities of Irish squires were proverbial. But
      you can imagine, my dear Nora, my mortification as I had to make this
      admission. If this sort of thing goes on I shall ask your uncle to let the
      place, and allow us all to live in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come, mother," said her daughter. "You ought to be thankful this
      morning&mdash;you ought to be. Oh, mother! do give me a loving kiss. It is
      so long, so long since you have done so, and somehow I am tired, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tired!" said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, alarmed and surprised by the new tone in
      Nora's voice. "You look tired. How black those shadows are under your
      eyes! and you have lost some of your color. There! of course I will kiss
      you, and I hope I am thankful, for we certainly have had wonderful mercies
      since your dear Uncle George came over and delivered us all. But what do
      you mean by special thankfulness this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, mother," said Nora. "Only <i>do</i> be thankful, <i>do</i>
      thank God for His mercies; and oh, mother, do give me that kiss!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, child! of course you shall have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O'Shanaghgan pressed her lips lightly to Nora's cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now eat your breakfast," she said. "These eggs are quite fresh, and the
      honey was bought only yesterday&mdash;you know you are fond of honey&mdash;and
      these hot cakes are made in a new and particularly nice way. Eat plenty,
      Nora, and do, my dear, try to restrain your emotions. It is quite terrible
      what wear and tear you give yourself over these feelings. It is really, my
      dear girl, unladylike; and let me tell you another thing, that when you
      lose your fresh wild-rose color, you will lose the greater part of your
      beauty. Dear me! it will not stay long with you if you excite yourself
      about every hand's turn in the ridiculous way you are doing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora did not say any more. She sat down to the breakfast table. Was her
      mother right? Was she indeed exciting herself over every hand's turn, and
      was that thing which had happened last night&mdash;which, now that it was
      over, caused her heart to beat a trifle too fast, and brought that tired,
      that very tired feeling into her sensitive frame&mdash;was that indeed but
      a trifling thing? Thank God&mdash;oh, thank God&mdash;she had been in
      time!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after breakfast Nora and Molly started once more for Slieve Nagorna.
      They went on the outside car this time, and Nora found her strength and
      courage returning as she handled the reins and urged Black Bess to speed.
      They presently reached their destination. Nora fastened up the horse as
      she had done on the previous day, and the girls began to climb the
      mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not be afraid when you see Andy," said Nora. "He was very weak
      last night, and will in all probability be in his house. I am going to
      arrange to have provisions sent to him every day. He will stay there now
      that he has got back again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how has he got back again? You will remember you never told me what
      happened last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you must not ask me, Molly. What happened last night can never be
      told by me to any human being. Only Angus knows something of it; and Angus
      will not tell anyone else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you were frightened? You look, Nora, as if you had gone through a
      great deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went through more than anyone will ever know," said Nora, "but I am
      very thankful."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls had now reached the old cabin. The tarpaulin was over the roof,
      but there was no smoke issuing from the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder he did not light his fire," said Nora in an anxious voice. "Will
      you go in with me, Molly, or shall I go alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go in with you," said Molly stoutly. "If you are not afraid, neither
      will I be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I afraid now?" said Nora, with a smile. "Come, Molly, I hope the poor
      creature is not very ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both girls entered the cabin. The tarpaulin had been so contrived that a
      piece hung over, and formed a temporary door. Nora now pushed it aside,
      and they both stepped into the miserable cabin. Andy was lying on the
      straw; the basket of provisions had not yet been touched, nor was the fire
      lit. Andy lay very still and quiet on the straw. Nora went up to him; his
      eyes were shut, and his head was slightly turned round, so that she could
      not at first get a proper glimpse of his face. She went on her knees, then
      presently touched his forehead with her own slim hand, calling his name
      softly at the same time. There was no answer&mdash;there would never be an
      answer again, for the wild Irishman was dead.

      CHAPTER XXXVI. &mdash; "I'M A HAPPY MAN!"
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was just before Christmas, and the preparations for the festive season
      were great at Castle O'Shanaghgan. The Squire was quite well again. Once
      more he walked all over his estate; once more he talked to his tenants;
      once more he joked and laughed with the other squires of the neighborhood.
      To a certain extent he had grown accustomed to the grand house with its
      grand furniture; to the terrible late dinner, at which he stoutly declined
      to appear in evening dress; to the English servants who knew none of his
      ways. He began to bear with these things, for Light o' the Morning, as he
      called his beloved Nora, was always by his side, and at night he could
      cast off the yoke which was so burdensome, and do what he liked in the
      barn. At Mrs. O'Shanaghgan's earnest request this barn was now rendered a
      tolerably comfortable bedroom; the walls had been papered, and the worst
      of the draughts excluded. A huge fireplace had been built out at one end,
      and the Squire did not object at all to a large turf fire on a cold night;
      but the old bedstead from Cronane still occupied its old place of honor in
      the best position in the room, the little deal table was destitute of
      cloth or ornament of any kind, and the tarpaulin on the floor was not
      rendered more luxurious by the presence of rugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rugs indeed!" said the Squire, snorting almost like a wild beast when his
      wife ventured to suggest a few of these comforts. "It is tripping me up
      you'd be? Rugs indeed! I know better."
    </p>
    <p>
      But compared to its condition when the Squire first occupied it, the barn
      was now a fairly comfortable bedroom, and Squire Murphy, Squire
      Fitzgerald, Squire Terence Malone, and the other squires of the
      neighborhood had many a good smoke there, and many a hearty laugh, as they
      said, quite "unbeknownst" to the English lady and her grand friends. And
      Nora, Molly, and even Biddy Murphy often shared in these festive times,
      laughing at the best jokes, and adding sundry witticisms on their own
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now, however, Christmas Eve, and Mrs. O'Shanaghgan's nearest
      English relatives were coming to spend the festive season at the Castle.
      Mrs. Hartrick, for the first time in her life, was to find herself in Old
      Ireland. Linda was also accompanying her mother, and Terence O'Shanaghgan
      was coming back for a brief visit to the home which one day would be his.
      Terence was now permanently settled in his uncle's office, and was likely
      to make an excellent man of business. Mr. Hartrick was glad of this, for
      he would much prefer the O'Shanaghgans to have money of their own in the
      future, rather than to depend on him to keep up the old place. Inwardly
      the Squire was fretting and fuming a good bit at Mr. Hartrick really
      owning Castle O'Shanaghgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must say, after all's said and done, the man is a gentleman," he
      remarked to his daughter; "but it frets me sore, Nora, that I should hold
      the place under him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's better, surely, than not having it at all," answered Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, be the powers! it is that," said the Squire; "but when I say so,
      it's about all. But I'll own the truth to you now, Nora: when they were
      smothering me up in that dreadful bedroom before you came, mavourneen, I
      almost wished that I had sold the place out and out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but, father, that time is long over," answered Nora; "and I believe
      that, after all, it will be good for the poor people round here that you
      should stay with them, and that there should be plenty of money to make
      their cabins comfortable, and to give them a chance in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I thought that, there'd not be another grumble out of me," said the
      Squire. "I declare to you, Nora, I'd even put on that abominable dinner
      suit which your lady mother ordered from the best Dublin tailors. My word!
      but it's cramped and fussed I feel in it. But I'd put it on, and do more
      than that, for the sake of the poor souls who have too little of this
      world's goods."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, father, do believe that it is so," said Nora; and now she put one
      of her soft arms round his neck, and raised herself on tiptoe and kissed
      his cheek. "Believe that it is so, for this morning I went round to the
      people, and in every cabin there was a bit of bacon, and a half-sack of
      potatoes, and fagots, and a pile of turf; and in every cabin they were
      blessing you, father; they think that you have sent them these Christmas
      gifts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah!" said the Squire, "it's sore to me that I have not done it; but I
      must say it's thoughtful of George Hartrick&mdash;very thoughtful. I am
      obliged to him&mdash;I cannot say more. Did you tell me the things were
      sent to every cabin, Nora&mdash;all over the place, alannah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every cabin, father," answered his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, that being the case, I'll truss myself up tonight. I will truly.
      Mortal man couldn't do more."
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations, not only outside but inside, for the arrival of the
      English family were going on with vigor. Pretty suites of rooms were being
      put into their best holiday dress for the visitors. Huge fires blazed
      merrily all over the house. Hothouse flowers were in profusion; hothouse
      fruit graced the table. The great hall quite shone with firelight and the
      gleam of dark old oak. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan dressed herself in her most regal
      black velvet dress for this auspicious occasion; and Nora, Molly, and even
      Biddy Murphy, all in white, danced excitedly in the hall. For Biddy
      Murphy, at Nora's special suggestion, had been asked to spend Christmas at
      the Castle. It was truly good to see her. Notwithstanding her celestial
      nose and very wide mouth, it would have been difficult to have looked at a
      happier face than hers. And, Irish as Biddy was, she had got the knack of
      coming round Mrs. O'Shanaghgan. She did this by her simple and undisguised
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mrs. O'Shanaghgan!" Biddy would cry, "it is the very most lovely
      thing I have ever clapped eyes on. I never saw anything so magnificent as
      this room. It's fairyland; the whole place is fairyland;" and as Biddy
      spoke her eyes would twinkle, and her big mouth would open, showing her
      immaculate white teeth. So much did she contrive to win over Mrs.
      O'Shanaghgan that that lady presented her with a soft white muslin dress
      for the present occasion. If Biddy was proud before, she was almost
      rampant with pleasure now. She twirled round, and gazed at herself in the
      long mirrors which had been inserted in the hall between the oak panels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, it's proud me ancestors, the old Irish kings, would be of me
      now," she was even heard to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, all things being ready, the time at last approached when the tired
      travelers would arrive. At the eleventh hour there had come a great
      surprise to Nora and Molly; for Mrs. Hartrick and Linda were bringing
      Stephanotie with them. How this came to pass was more than either girl
      could possibly conjecture; but they both felt that it was the final crown
      of their happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I ever forget," said Nora, "that but for Stephanotie lending us that
      money I should not have been able to run away to Ireland, and my dear,
      dearest father might not now have been alive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sound of wheels was at last heard without.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, girleens, and let's give them a proper Irish welcome," said the
      Squire, standing on the steps of the old house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora ran to him, and he put his arm round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then, Nora, as the carriage comes up, you help me with the big Irish
      cheer. Hip, hip, hurrah! and <i>Caed Mille a Faitha</i>. Now then, let
      every one who has got a drop of Irish blood in him or her raise the old
      cheer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor gentle English Mrs. Hartrick turned quite pale when she heard these
      sounds; but Mr. Hartrick was already beginning to understand his Irish
      relatives; and as to Stephanotie, she sprang from the carriage, rushed up
      the steps, and thrust a huge box of bon-bons into Squire O'Shanaghgan's
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am an American girl," she said; "but I guess that, whether one is Irish
      or American, one likes a right-down good sweetheart. Have a bon-bon,
      Squire O'Shanaghgan, for I guess that you are the man to enjoy it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why then, my girl, I'd like one very much," said the Squire; "but don't
      bother me for a bit, for I have to speak to my English relatives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come along in, Stephanotie, do," said Molly. "I see that you are just
      as eccentric and as great a darling as ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess I'm not likely to change," answered Stephanotie. "I was born with
      a love of bon-bons, and I'll keep it to the end of the chapter."
    </p>
    <p>
      But now Mrs. Hartrick and Mrs. O'Shanaghgan had met. The two English
      ladies immediately began to understand each other. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan,
      without a word, slipped her hand inside her sister-in-law's arm, and they
      walked slowly across the magnificent hall and up the wide stairs to the
      palatial bedroom got ready for the traveler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the fun and excitement downstairs became fast and furious. The Squire
      clapped his brother-in-law, George Hartrick, on the shoulder; the Squire
      laughed; the Squire very nearly hallooed. Terence looked round him in
      undisguised amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not have known the old place," he said, turning to Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora gave a quick sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is my mother?" said the lad then.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has gone upstairs with Aunt Grace; but run after her, Terry, do,"
      said his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence gave another glance round, in which pride for the home where he
      was born kindled once more in his dark eyes. He then rushed up the stairs
      three steps at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then," said the Squire, "it's cramped and bothered I am in these
      clothes. What possesses people to make Merry-andrews of themselves night
      after night beats my comprehension. In my old velveteen jacket and
      knee-breeches I am a man&mdash;in this tomfoolery I do not feel as good as
      my own footman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look very well in your dinner dress all the same, O'Shanaghgan," said
      Mr. Hartrick. And he added, glancing from Nora to her father, "I am glad
      to see you quite recovered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! it's she has done it," said the Squire, drawing Nora forward and
      pressing her close to his heart. "She's a little witch. She has done fine
      things for me, and I am a happy man to-night. Yes, I will own to it now,
      I'm a happy man; and perhaps there are more things in the world than we
      Irish people know of. Since I have my barn to sleep in I can bear the
      house, and I am much obliged to you, George&mdash;much obliged to you.
      But, all the same, it's downright I'd have hated you, when you altered
      this old place past knowing, had it not been for my little girl, Light o'
      the Morning, as I call her."
    </p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
